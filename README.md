Vitae Magazine Website

This is an ongoing magazine conept that seeks to be on the progressive end of contemporary literature.
To an extent I am not even close minded about glypch combinations in that you can submit your writing to this publication and be loose in your typographic work.
You can misspell words. I am more interested in the ideas and I know that flying into a keyboard can bring with it spelling errors but so long as the idea is amazing.
I am fine with that.
I am going to be growing this into a magazine that will find its way to www.vitaemagazine.com in time for now it is being hosted here.
I am going to be growing this website like a plant.
Maybe you can help me water it.
