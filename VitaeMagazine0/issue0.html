			<h2>I am Lucius Pixel and this document exists to help me cope with some troubling life experiences that are kind of hard for me to shake ... I could be fantasizing about injuring myself or cutting myself but instead I am actually just starting to get a handle on some troubling memories that actually provide me with the style of pain that an artist can work with to create more advanced than what I would consider typical style writing ... to the degree that you feel as though this writing is advanced is to the degree that I have experienced what I feel is advanced forms of pain providing me with the need to create advanced forms of writing to balance out my thoughts and to keep me centered and moving in a healthy life direction ... to an extent I am actually the opposite of proud of this writing and I wish I did not feel the need to write in this style as quite frankly my life history is catching up with me and I am actually just beginning to understand the idea of what literature actually is and I feel like the forms of this writing are what I can be proud of but what the actual content of the writing is ... is going to hopefully become with healing and coping go in a direction that is actually going to be less satirical and more useful to society at large ... I understand this is not useful writing ... I understand it is off putting writing at this point ... but to an extent at this point in my life ... I myself am not useful and I myself am off putting ... so I in some fashion am not surprised that this writing exists and to an extent as for the last portion of the last essay ... that is a direct reaction to Kanye West's latest exploits and to an extent if anyone is going to take that position it is going to be me as I am more trained for such a thing ... its just that what Kanye West just recently did is the opposite of cool and Kanye West is supposed to be cool ... he just is not right now and might never be again ... I understand completely what Kanye West wants ... its just not going to happen ... and the last portion of the last section of this writing is in my opinion what Kanye West inspired as to me that is where I step over the line as an author as that writing should not exist but then again Kanye West went in a certain direction in his field and I felt the need to mirror what Kanye West did in my writing so as to have an accurate record in literature of what is happening poltiically in the arts right now ... Kanye West is to me now less an artist and more someone that needs psychiatric care ... I went through extensive psychiatric care and to an extent ... it gave me something to think about ... I personally think the same treatment should be afforded to Kanye West as what I have recently witnessed is unacceptable in the Pop Arts ... and because the Pop Arts are in a state of unacceptability ... the American Literature that I am crafting so as to be accurately in line with the Pop Arts is actually what I consider a commentary on what is happening ... I have been through much ... so quite frankly ... my writing is the mirror I am using to improve my life with as this is where I am right now ... I know I do not want to be here ... I know this is not where I want my head space to be ... and now that I know that this is where my head space is ... I can begin to grow and mature and explore a different direction ... guided by my writing as I would like there to be less of my writing mirroring myself and I would like to go in a direction that has me portraying the thoughts that I know I should be writing as opposed to the thoughts that I am ... I am growing as an author ... and I am interested in where this will go from here but quite frankly I am upset that this is where I am right now and noting this ... I will seek to go in a more positive direction ... thereby creating a situation where I will know I hit Rock Bottom ... and now I can begin getting up again and engaging in the professional life that I know I am capable of.</h2>

			Lucius Pixel was not Lucius Pixel to Lucius Pixel. No. Rather Lucius Pixel was a shell … a form … a creation that was bringing to life that which Lucius Pixel needed to. He was a manifestation in a moment of all that Lucius Pixel was going to achieve in his life. He had been on world adventures, local adventures, academic adventures, and literary adventures. He had stood in front of crowds. He had been smoked out on the highest sativa that his city had to offer. He was crafting a letter to the Goddess every day of his life. He was his own mystery and he was aware that above him was a sky that lasted forever and in that sky was this planet that was growing more connected and capable of understanding that which it had always had questions about. Lucius Pixel was a man that was exotically educated in several fields. He was a man that had recovered from hundreds of dreams that bespoke him in the night. During his time of his life he had been treated like a lunatic even though his life made sense to him. He was treated like he was crazy even though he was a champion of the literate works of life. In the world of worlds Lucius Pixel was a creature that was destined for sitting at a desk and staring at a computer and exploring his inner mind. There was a time about a decade ago that Lucius Pixel was interested in nothing less than scouring the world searching for something. Something.
			</p>
			<p>
			That which Lucius Pixel was looking for had to be somewhere. It had to be over there. On some other continent. In some other city. Lucius Pixel had recently discovered what he was actually in search of looking for. He was looking for his confidence. For his moment to say that he knew he existed and that he was missing out on nothing. Lucius Pixel now knew that he was missing out on nothing. He had finished scouring the world. He was now ready to sit back and begin his writings. He was ready to change himself through his written works and in this life he was challenging himself to be more of that writer that he knew he was capable of being.
			</p>
			<p>
			That brings us to this writing that Lucius Pixel was crafting. He was sitting at his desk in front of his Windows Machine and he had his hands on his chordless keyboard and he was challenging himself to get into this moment right up to this period right here ( . ) 
			</p>
			<p>
			Now he was after the moment. He had written his period. His period. That invention that carved a space out in his mind. There was a universe. There were aeons of epochs of space that were the multiverse and in that multiverse there was that period that Lucius Pixel wrote. End of Sentence. Lucius Pixel was now at the next sentence of his life. Lucius Pixel has survived a threat on his life. He had survived countless psychiatric hospitalizations and now Lucius Pixel was in fact something new. He was interesting. He was experiencing catharsis in a way that changed the way he viewed the world. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There was this moment that was this moment that was where his human form was crafting these sentences and through these sentences Lucius Pixel was challenging the universe to acknowledge his thoughts and his experiences so that when Lucius Pixel sat down to craft a work of literature Lucius Pixel would know that the world was watching and waiting and resting itself on his words and going to the places that Lucius Pixel would have someone go. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel was high on coffee right now. He was thinking to himself about Amazon Dot Com and about how he was a single account away from uplifting his writing en mass to this thing. This place on the internet where he could finally find himself spending the next 60 years of his life crafting his Kindle Books for a company that would ostensibly be around for the next 60 years. Who was going to challenge the Amazon. The Amazon that place where no one knows what there is to be found and in this place there is a sensation that quite possibly the world is finally changed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Because of Amazon Dot Com an author has the chance to sit down at his computer. Write his works out and then without the need for anyone else place his or her works in the public marketplace for better or for worse for the world to download at their leisure. Lucius Pixel had thought to himself that he wished to be a Radio Disc Jockey … or an Journalist or a Dancer or something exotic but then Lucius Pixel thinks about it and gets to writing these words. These creations. These combinations of letters that lead only to the growing ability to communicate that Lucius Pixel is living in a male apartment with clothing strewn on the ground and a kitchen that is in need of being cleaned up and a bed that is finally made. Lucius Pixel is on welfare and is living on the lowest rung of the financial ladder desperately trying to get in tune with what it is in this new environment that Lucius Pixel needs to be doing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel needs to be writing. He needs to be waking up every morning and just crafting his words. Lucius Pixel needs to be writing. Essays and Stories and whatever writing this is. There is no limit to the style with which Lucius Pixel is planning on writing. He is crafting a moment in time where the world can endlesslessly consider the fact that Lucius Pixel is a receiver of mystical communications. Where do these words come from? How does a brain in fact come to the point where it can endlessly craft these words in these combinations for the purposes of captivating an audience. Lucius Pixel from time to time Believes that he could quite possibly be in telepathic communications with himself in the future and back into himself in the past as Lucius Pixel thinks to himself that quite possibly when he considers what he should have done in a significant moment of mental relapse he wonders if on some level his former self listens to his future self and makes a different decision in regards to life. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If Lucius Pixel could speak a word to himself he would tell himself. Nicholas do not go to London in the year of your 20th. Stay in school and finish your design plans and consider that there is a world where you can be accumulating design resources and helping people understand what it is that they are experiencing as they step into your design office. You never finished design school Lucius Pixel and because of this you entered into the world of English Literature … that place where people like you champion the written word and take to crafting those letters that could quite possibly change the world at large if people would just listen to you. If you were given a quarter of a chance and people took the time to possibly consider for a moment that you received exotic training in your ethos. 
			</p>
			<p>
			What did you experience Lucius Pixel? What is it that you became as contrasted with what you became in different time lines? How have your decisions affected your immortal branches of experience? How often do you get murdered Lucius Pixel? Why is it that you have a lack of fear of disexistence? Why did you explain to your roommate your thoughts on why you lack a fear of the ends of time? When you explained to your roommate that in the finalization of your consciousness you lack the ability to comprehend your former self and in that transition from this point in time to the next you consider the fact that what is occurring is that this is a moment that is captured in a conversation that is held by sentient human beings walking around the world and that quite frankly you are born into a moment that is the stopping of time as though the universe and the consciousnessless have no concept of time and that it is life itself that has an experience with time because it is life that notes the transferences of energy between what was and what will be.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel thinks about life and the experiences that life has and notes that be you a dolphin or be you an ant or be you a human or be you a feline when consciousness closes its eyes does not consciousness irregardless of the form of consciousness experience the same darkness. When you are a dolphin or a blue whale or an ant or a spider or a human being does not all life experience the darknenss the same way. The unending void of the salvation of the lives of the planet and can you not discern how far into the future you are from interest in a civilization to take care of life. In the beginning of civilization there was quite frankly no regard for life. There was life that was hard and brutal and as humans we destroyed millions of lives throughout our existence but the future. Yes the very future that is always waiting for us to decide that it is occurring right now is the kind of future where life is cherished and stroven to be understood from all angles.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel believes that there is nothing more interesting than life itself. A single life form is more interesting than a star or even a black hole or a nebula. A single life is more interesting than a rock or a river. It almost seems to Lucius Pixel that the universe and all that this universe is belongs to the lives that exist within this universe. There quite frankly could be life on other planets but  that is not our concern. Our concern should quite frankly be to take into account this life. This place in existence and we should be working to perfect our way of life. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel wants to know how exactly he can improve life for life. What does Lucius Pixel have to do in some small way to observe the current state of life and to create something or to say something that will have a ripple effect that can quite frankly improve the conditions of life. When life is thinking of Lucius Pixel Lucius Pixel is thinking of life. It is the condition of life to be present in the moment that Lucius Pixel is aware of. Throughout the human story there are men and women that take to the realm of existence and craft moments that shape the consciousness of the human experience for ever. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel would like to point out that in defense of the tradition of authorship that he is involved in he is crafting an experience of writing that is bespoken to be unlike any other. Lucius Pixel is writing and publishing in real time and there are going to be flaws in Lucius Pixel's Writing as this is his journal writing. This is Lucius Pixel's Performance space where he takes to crafting ideas and symbols that will hopefully affect your life in the most positive way.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel currently has no reader base. He currently has no relationship with the human condition on the level of writing that he is on. Lucius Pixel is searching for a niche in which he can perform his vital function of writing and quite possibly try and resurrect himself and finally accomplish that moment in trade where he is able to buy some food in trade for his writing. Which day will it be that Lucius Pixel can trade his writing for food. When is Lucius Pixel going to understand his world to the extent that other life forms are going to trade their finances for Lucius Pixel's Writing? 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel has been writing for thousands of pages and is now in the moment rushed through himself with coffee and this is his first work. This is his first work for Amazon Dot Com … for Bezos and his manifestation of reality Lucius Pixel is crafting items for this marketplace in the hopes that one day people will consider him someone of note. Someone of authorship that improves the lives of his readers in a way that no one ever has before in the history of writing. In the history of writing Lucius Pixel has never taken part in the professional environment. There are thousands of authors but Lucius Pixel is thinking to himself that quite frankly what does he offer as an author that no other author offers. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel offers 33 years of experience that quite frankly is paltry compared to the authors that are 55. It is a life of patience that is the author even though when Lucius Pixel is writing on his coffee. When Lucius Pixel is listening to his music .There is nothing more exciting to Lucius Pixel than a romp through the alphabet on a keyboard tapping out words like he was built to do. In the realms of existence Lucius Pixel is crafting an experience through his writing that will forever be challenged by the people that have never known him to be anyone other than this man that wears a gray trench coat in the winter time and that could not possibly be important because Lucius Pixel is on welfare and quite frankly how could a man on welfare be deemed important by society. Lucius Pixel speaks for all the men and women that are on the lowest financial ladder and would like to point out that one day … just watch … Lucius Pixel is going to build something. 
			</p>
			<p>
			An author is less not interested in the world but more understanding of how the world works at a commercial level in that there is value in thinking and that quite frankly that is all an author does. Thinks. Authors think and through their thinking they craft moments in time that change them forever. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Currently Lucius Pixel has no schedule. He has no employer. He has no one that is making decisions in his life other than himself. Lucius Pixel woke up today and had a small Eureka moment in regards to Amazon Dot Com. This is where Lucius Pixel is going to write. This is the platform that Lucius Pixel is going to share his writing with. This is who Lucius Pixel is going to partner with because Lucius Pixel has the next thirty years of his life to focus on writing and to continue to craft his creations of sentencery and to challenge his generation to become more in tune with the words that are coming out of their mouths.
			</p>
			<p>
			Through the thoughts that a generation is thinking comes the creations that a generation is remembered for. There was a generation that created Football and there was a generation that created Baseball and there was a generation that created Coca Cola and there was a generation that created the Automobile and there was a generation that created the Computer and now we have a generation whose only calling from the perspective of Lucius Pixel is to use this computer. We have a computer to use right now. We can forever in this computer and in this environment of crafting language uplift our consciousness in such a way that humanity will forever benefit from the walking through the confusion that was brought on by this onslaught of thought that was this computer.
			</p>
			<p>
			This computer is in the mind of Lucius Pixel and this computer is quite frankly a mirror that is showing humanity what it is. When it comes to the internet … how else is humanity supposed to view this computer than a mirror that shows us our thoughts back to us in glowing form. We no longer have to bring down trees for our writing. The author no longer needs to carve pulp into sheets of paper. The author no longer needs the quill of a goose or the ink made from dense material. The author can now in this Amazon of thought sit down at a keyboard and go into a process of crafting language into existence as the author has always done and in this process he can craft his works into files that rest in a database that Earth has access to and in this process Earth can now read all that has access to this computer and for the author this all comes down to quality. The process of finding the most quality author is in progress as it always is in progress and back through time authors have led quiet lives in their studios silent with their thoughts but today.
			</p>
			<p>
			Oh today Lucius Pixel notes how luxurious it is for the author. The author today has access to all of it's favorite music as well as all of its favorite literary journals as well as all of its favorite visuals and everything. There is no end to the level that an author can be inspired today and in the coming decades authors are only going to become more influential as it is through authorship that thoughts become manifest in the written word and are captured and put on display for the world to comprehend as the ceremony of authorship is something that Lucius Pixel is well aware of in the most constant need to express oneself that exists.
			</p>
			<p>
			The lock and the key. Lucius Pixel is in the process of unlocking the lock of Amazon where he begins with one file. Then he crafts a second file. It is time that Lucius Pixel created his master account with Amazon Dot Com and just started publishing. Lucius Pixel could contact a literary agent or a publishing house but then Lucius Pixel's writing would not be as authentic as it is right now. This is unvarnished Lucius Pixel. This is Lucius Pixel dialect and these are Lucius Pixel typos and this is the style of writing that Lucius Pixel is crafting for an audience that exists right now but is just unaware of the writings of Lucius Pixel. There are going to be people that find Lucius Pixel's writing abhorent and useless but Lucius Pixel just keeps writing. Just keeps filling up his account so that when you write in the name Lucius Pixel you know who you are getting. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It is up to Lucius Pixel to write these words and to explore the written language to his heart's and mind's content to the extent that if you find yourself thinking something new or feeling something reading this you are in the care of Lucius Pixel and his work and he is not interested in letting you down as a reader. It is no small task to be a reader of Lucius Pixel as in this meeting of you and Lucius Pixel through Lucius Pixel's writing you are experiencing the very best and most refined movements of his mind.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel is fairly certain that you get one chance at life to defend your eternal existence before an immortal deity that is overseeing this entire human experience. Lucius Pixel finds that writing and authorship present to Lucius Pixel the greatest means of doing the opposite of what interested him as a child.
			</p>
			<p>
			When Lucius Pixel was a child the adventure was elsewhere … it was in seeing something different that had never been seen before by himself. Now the adult of Lucius Pixel understands the same lesson of the need to see something that has never been seen before by himself but now Lucius Pixel is excited by the possibility that he is daily crafting something that has never been seen by anyone else before in the history of humanity. His writing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Take this piece of writing for example. This writing is exciting to Lucius Pixel because he has no idea where this is going. He is writing and crafting and stabilizing himself and crafting a moment in his existence where he is sitting down and letting his fingers tap dance across a keyboard that is ultimately his device for exploring his mind. He is as interested in his mind as at this point quite frankly you are not.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel is extremely interested in what his mind has to say as though there are dimensions to his brain that are working in conjunction with each other to craft a consciousness where Lucius Pixel is going to defend his work consistently. There is a brazen need in Lucius Pixel to craft words in combinations that have never existed before. Lucius Pixel is seeking to become a meme that produces high quality works of writing for the ultimate purpose of showcasing what he has learned up to this moment right here. Lucius Pixel is learning from himself in that he is conscious of what he is conscious of and that in this consciousness there is a need to find out where these words come from. Lucius Pixel has exposed himself to thousands of pages all glowing the same shade of brightness and color and Lucius Pixel is deciding every day what his future tradition is going to be encapsulated by. When it comes to Lucius Pixel Lucius Pixel is a guardian of Lucius Pixel in that Lucius Pixel is an author that brings people closer to Lucius Pixel so that Lucius Pixel can challenge the ancient traditions of authorship in ways that have never been done before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Ellie Goulding sang the song that inspired this latest change in consciousness when she sang the note that spoke of bring right now and that it is possible to be a star of the human race and to stare at the sun and the color that is the purest color there ever was. The sun itself is a color that is the purest color humans have ever experienced and Lucius Pixel dreams of the day when the Human Race takes on an eternal holiday and stares at a website that is focused on sharing the sun with the Human Race as though there simply needs to be a web site on the internet that is connected to a telescope that is staring at something in space and then through radio and television and film and magazine and all forms of communication it is most possible to as a civilization collectively share a single moment of inspiration that gives us all visions of something that we have always been aware of but never in a singular moment that marks the tradition that brings us all together as choose the sun or the moon to focus on and remember that somehow we are here in this universe that is changing every day for the better and the worse at the same time as though there is a message embedded in this consciousness that is ultimately waiting to come out and Lucius Pixel is waiting for internet oriented holidays that have nothing to do with commerce and everything to do with inspiration.
			</p>
			<p>
			The highest form of inspiration that Lucius Pixel can conceive of in his imagination is as follows. Imagine with Lucius Pixel as he shares his largest idea with you. The largest idea that Lucius Pixel has achieved in his imagination is a space station unlike any that anyone has ever seen before. Imagine for instance that the moon itself is wrapped with a torus like structure that wraps itself around the equator of the moon. Imagine that the moon is wrapped in a Dyson Sphere of coherence that allows for the moon itself to be a place where humans can recreate Eden from the Sand of Existence itself. This immediate universe is the work studio of the human race. Currently humans are focusing their attention on accumulating resources for the accumulation of more resources and the professional world at large is focused on next week as opposed to next millenium. There is no peace because there is no trust in each other. There is a consistent build up of war and a constant need to concern oneself with observing love and finding love and children concern life very much. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There is a need in Lucius Pixel to create a consciousness that will stand the test of time that is focused on patience. Remember there is a human desire to be wholistic and should a civilization lose its holistic peace it will degrade itself into a state of destruction and feel the need to destroy. Lucius Pixel understands something. He was literally brought into this world from a moment that was crafted after Western Earth had decided to engage in eternal combat. The Great War always occurs in the past. There is nor ever has been a future dedicated to war. There is no future in War because War is a force that in the future is looked down upon with gargantuan eyeballs that remind war that War is being outmoded in the understanding that Peace is something that is little understood. When it comes to Peace … how does that play into the world at large. What is Peace. Since Peace has never existed and because Peace has never been given its chance in the Western Civilization … what role does this computer and its interconnected nature play in the role of future peace. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Lucius Pixel is ready for war. In his readiness for war he finds a comfort in peace as though as Lucius Pixel ages he experiences the same hatred of different peoples that the loss of his naïve brings with. Lucius Pixel experiences ancient hatred coursing through his veins but then Lucius Pixel thinks to himself that vengeance and retribution and revenge are the only three concepts that post cede violence. Violence on a sphere only brings with it the return of violence. War is supposedly never ending but in the hunt for what the future could conceivably be … War is not an option because War and the literary symbol of War is always a concept of the past. There is no war. There never has been war. There has only ever been alphas deciding the fates of betas that look towards alphas for guidance in this life.
			</p>
			<p>
			Governments communicate with governments and in this time period where a single human can gain access to roughly the same communicae that ancient leaders have access to it is a spherical consciousness that gains the greatest insight into the human condition. We walk through life making decisions that ultimately affect our children and some of us make sense of War and Destruction as though these are sound economic principles that bring raw materials into the hands of the fewest number of people because that is the current trend in commerce.
			</p>
			<p>
			What needs to happen so that the largest number of raw materials are under the control of the fewest number of people? What is the magical spell that a single human needs to cast on another human being to convince said human being that such a human being is greater? What is the spell of the quote unquote most powerful human being? What tradition does a human being experience leading up to their being crowned the greatest and most powerful? When it comes to power … what is power if not an ability to convince another human being to give up that part of themselves that is their life. People around the world give up their lives so that they may survive in conditions that make their lives miserable. How many people are unaware of what makes them happy? How often are the arts NOT taught in government schools because it is the Artist that accomplishes a great work of art that can stare a master merchant in the eyes and note the equivalence. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It is through the arts that men and women open up their consciousnesses to the highest potential that can be achieved. In a world where the arts are the prime focus of the human consciousness there is a greater ability for that ecosystem to observe reality with a beautiful heart. How many people find that which surrounds them to be magical? How many people that never take the time to write find the Bible, the Torah, the Quran magical? What is magical about a book that has 1200 pages to it. There are so few authors in time that entire organizations are dedicated to remembering what a group of people or a single person took the time to craft with their own hands. Society takes to writing so infrequently that often writers like L Ron Hubbard are seen for people that they are not. Why are not people worshipping the men and women that craft homes and architecture. Why is not the Architect of the Replacement of the World Trade Center worshipped less than L Ron Hubbard? Is not a sky scraper more impressive than a book? We are talking about billions of men and women worshipping the works of quite possibly just a few authors. How many men or women in total combined in effort wrote the story of the BIBLE? How many men and women in total wrote the book that is the Quran? How many men and women in total wrote the book that is the Torah? Now how many people have read these books in total? How much of a magical spell is being organizationally cast as if you look to Israel now … there is a high rate of violence in the ancient city of the Old Testament. If you look to the ancient city of Mecca there is a large Cube that is the global magnet for such adherents. Then you have the Vatican which is the headquarters of all thoughts bible related. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Of the three major world religions how do you personally feel about their respective head quarters? Which space has the least violence in the year 2014 and the highest quality of living. I personally do not know as I Lucius Pixel have never been. Which region has the highest quality of living … the Old Testament Headquarters, the Qu;'ran Headquarters or the Bible's Headquarters? Where is civilization being promoted the most authentically? From the stereotypes that I know of I find that Israel the home of the Old Testament is typically considered VIOLENT! The Mecca is typically considered a magnet for Humans that Worship Qu'ran Writing and then there is the Vatican which is typically considered a city of Rome. Rome the highest civilization of ancient times that continues to inspire the future in ways that provide for the common good over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
			When one observes the foundations for certain books it is quite interesting to note the net effects of worshipped literature on their headquarters. There is a peace in the Vatican that I am vaguely aware of that quite possibly all people could learn from. Peace is possible and peace is profitable and I ask the question when it comes to violence … what is there to gain?
			</p>
			<p>
			I have deep problems with violence as a story because the Great War in my eyes does something horrific over and over again. The Great War is the War between humans that has been raging since the first weapon was built. There is a need in War to defeat your opponent and bring their civilization to the point where through violence they admit the aggressor's civilization is the greater. I personally find this to be a weak and false way of existing in the world. Through Fear civilization cannot reign because through fear a civilization can be brought to it's knees but I ask this. Why is there blood fighting blood on earth? 
			</p>
			<p>
			At what point was the human form set against itself? How did the human form find a deep seated need to combat itself? What does a planet of humans have to gain in its short sighted as though this planet was all there was mindset? From the onset of consciousness the human condition has had the sky in common. Throughout History humanity has had the sky in common in such a way that for all time the greatest moments in history have been the undocumented moments where the most eyeballs have been observing the sky. There is no more peaceful and inspirational way to exist than to observe the sky. The sky is limitless and the mysteries of the sky and the understanding of these mysteries is where the ultimate long term profits lie. If you want to recoup on your investment there is the sky and that which the sky has to offer. The sky. That which radiates in all directions from Earth. It has been said that the Sun is the center of the Solar System but I posit this.
			</p>
			<p>
			Earth is the center of consciousness in the universe. Just because the Earth orbits something. Does not mean that you cannot call Earth the Center of something. Earth is for better or worse the human starting point for observing and exploring the stars. The further into the future Earth goes the more financially equal the human race becomes and the more divergences from each other stem from the arts. The value of a man is not in what a man collects but in what a man creates. There is a need in humanity to create something. There is a lack of consciousness in the typical human being from this author's perspective. Do not fear that which is quite a lack of understanding. We are not all meant to be the same. Some of us upgrade their abilities in dramatic fashion slowly through time. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If you have spent the last twenty years of your life absorbing television and media and have spent little time crafting your own versions of media then writing like this may seem difficult to craft. I would like to point out that Lucius Pixel has been writing for roughly 26 years since his kindergarten class and has had an attendance rate of well over 90% throughout his days on this planet . He is an author that is in search of the perfect combination of words that can inspire someone to the highest extent possible. When Ellie Goulding is singing about the stars of the Human Race Lucius Pixel is writing as though he is one on behalf of his human counterparts in their disparate fields. 
			</p>
			<p>
			When it comes to Writing this is what Lucius Pixel does. His mind has been crafted by Lucius Pixel to be long winded and eloqute in his scribbles. His writing are quite frankly something of a meaning to be decyphered. There is a deep seated need in Lucius Pixel to be as thoughtful as he can be. Lucius Pixel is not an authority figure but instead he is someone that is trying to sell you on writing by writing himself. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Writing. The written word. Lucius Pixel would like to point out that if all men and all woman wrote more. There would be more understanding of the written word and less mystery in the world. When Lucius Pixel was a child there was nothing more mesmerizing than a book to him. He loved the book. That which the book symbolized and in time the book became the opposite of a mystery to Lucius Pixel which is why Lucius Pixel lost his faith. Around the time period that Lucius Pixel had successfully crafted writing in numbers equivalent to the Holy Roman Catholic Bible … when Lucius Pixel had produced AS MUCH AUTHORHIP as the King James Bible … Nicholas lost his ability to be mystified by the Bible. It is possible for the Bible to be written. It is possible for a dishonest author to craft a message that will bring his readers into a cult. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Consider David Koresh. Consider the Cult. Consider that in time there are people that have the ability to craft cults of a myriad of different kinds. Now consider how dishonest this is. For a single human to take on the role of deity and not reveal how they have their ability. For an artist or a cult leader to lead his or her flock into a state of hypnosis that is all encompassing is not moral. There is no morality to be found in cults. In small groups of people putting on a show that mesmerizes people. An organization of people is much more profound than a cult. A cult is a group of people that are brought in through manipulation to believe in the omnipotent leader in such a way that that leader is taken out of society and spoken of in tones that are all wrong. An honest leader is someone that is consistently reminding you that yes such a person started off as an infant just like all others.
			</p>
			<p>
			It is the leaders that cut themselves in the eyes of their followers that are the greatest. The leaders that fluctuate between heroic demeanor and humble servant. The leaders that continually leave it up to you to continue being influenced by themselves. The leaders that through statistics and happenstance found their ways into certain chairs and through tradition take on a certain position in life. Lucius Pixel is a leader but Lucius Pixel is not interested in flock creation. Lucius Pixel just wants to be a thought that never existed before. Lucius Pixel wants his legacy to be a single meme that is forever being worked on this concept that quite frankly you are free. I am free. We are free BUT organizations still require leadership. Being a leader is a job just like being a follower is. Organizations are built on trust and if a Leader usurps the trust or if the follower allows him or herself to forget that the leader was in fact an infant once. Problems arise.
			</p>
			<p>
			Hysteria is common. Hysteria is what accumulates over time such as the Creation Museum in Kentucky. That is a sign of Hysteria. There is not a single author through time that deserves that treatment. The Creation Museum is the end result of a story that has gotten out of control. Yes the Great Books of Religions are impressive BUT not to the extent that they deserve CULTS! Associated with them. When are the leaders of these cults going to remind these people that these books were not written by the current leadership? There are no current leaders that write books. Current leaders are not famous for their thoughts as much as they are famous for their networking.
			</p>
			<p>
			How often is networking taken on as a form of magic. How magical is it to travel the world upgrading your six degrees of separation? What is it about individuals that allow them to place their souls in the hands of the few? With this internet there is now an ability for the many to lead the many.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like Reddit Dot Com. This is a website that is crafting an ethos that was built by the many. The many can now lead the many with the computer being the leader. Anyone can chime in now and take on a dominant meme position and can craft understanding as the computer is becoming more and more pure daily.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a product of the Human Race the Computer is a Pure Device and through its purity we upgrade ours. I know you may think that the computer is dirty right now with porn and hate and all of that but that is just where the computer came into our consciousness. Every generation can now make decisions based on how they feel about the current state of the computer and every generation can now build on the previous generation in more and more civilized forms. When the Computer is thought of as a Meme itself it slows people down and speeds up thinking en mass.
			</p>
			<p>
			There have never been more people reading than there are right now. There are always going to be more and more people reading more and more up and into time from the onset of the internet on. Reading and Writing and Media Literacy are going up and these are the people that are going to be leading society into a direction that is only going to become more and more literate and more and more in favor of the producers of writing.
			</p>
			<p>
			There is an upper limit to authorship. In a world where every human has written a book there would be a collective understanding of where the books come from. In a world where few people write books books are considered mysterious and full of power when I can tell you where books come from. They are not mystical creations asking for peace and commerce. A book is a collection of thoughts from a single or multiple authors that serves as a means of passing the time. An author can make writing or something else. Sometimes writing is chosen by certain people and over a long enough time period writing like the Bible gets taken for something that it was never meant to be.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now you have the merchant. This person that looks at life and creates nothing but is always looking for products to sell. This is the person that ruins the tradition of authorship. The merchant. This is the person that collects valuable things and dances whatever dance is necessary to sell well anything. A merchant just wants to know which dance is the most currency accumulating dance to dance and that is the dance they do. That is the speech they give.
			</p>
			<p>
			I see the merchant as a man or woman that earns their living under question. Merchants. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Then you have authors. Then you have Jeff Bezos. This is a man that is not a merchant. He actually created something. He did not pick up rocks from the ground and champion them as valuable in a form of ritualistic dance. Jeff Bezos has a vision. He is the man that is crafting a content management system for commerce. There is no reason that one day you log into Amazon Dot Com as an author and work for Jeff Bezos. I twenty years ago did not start the process of creating a marketplace for writing and products. Jeff Bezos is quite possibly the most fair merchant there has ever been. He is certainly the one that has the brightest vision for this computer.
			</p>
			<p>
			Imagine a future of Bezos where Bezos is crafting marketplaces where the process of sale is brought to the most complex and simple process there is. Jeff Bezos apparantly sees a day involving this computer where the tradition of the merchant is upgraded. Jeff Bezos is a futuristic Merchant in that he does away with inefficiency in that he stores everything in one place. Lets you know what he has in one place and provides for you to acquire anything you want through his business. He is constantly growing this place that a man like me can craft writing for in the possibility of earning resources that can be traded for the trades that are made on behalf of writing like this.
			</p>
			<p>
			I look to the future of our future and wonder what Lucius Pixel is doing. Well while Jeff Bezos is crafting a marketplace for commerce Lucius Pixel is taking on the role of the traditional author and is creating something for Jeff Bezos to Sell. Jeff Bezos earns his living organizing the creations of the inventors and the producers of life and Jeff Bezos produces a space in eternity where all that is created can be bought and sold. This is more work than a merchant typically does. A merchant is typically seen as lacking vision but let me be the first to my knowledge to state that when a merchant gets it historically correct … life changes.
			</p>
			<p>
			Typically an author has a number of hoops to jump through to gain access to what Jeff Bezos provides but I am in the process of crafting a document of writing that allows me to gain a global reach and also to circumvent the entire literary process that typically exists. I can share my thoughts on this platform and quite frankly exist as an author that through time can be read.
			</p>
			<p>
			I can also leave my writing behind as every day I know my writing will exist for more time than I will. How does a mortal like Lucius Pixel feel when they think of the fact that they are crafting something that with the right treatment is timeless. There is a timelessness to writing where if the right forces collide what an author creates floats through time for more time than the author of this writing. The words of a writer exist outside of time where the author exists inside of time.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am changing like the ether of existence as I write the words that challenge my place in existence and quite frankly I could be an author that reads himself in fifty years and wonders who he used to be as I write letters to myself in poetic fashion for no reason other than to pass the time profitably and am surrounded by the symbols of this time period and spend time exerting myself in such as way that I am leaving something behind that marks my existence like a flag in this land that I built from pulling down a branch from a tree and fastening a large leaf to it tied with some vine so that I know that to myself I was an infant once and then grew through time and experienced great adventures and then slowed down and spent his time crafting a moment to realize that the world was less cruel than fair. The violent meet violent ends and the peaceful meet violent ends. There is a fairness to all of this in that no matter who you are you were born the same as all the rest and then through statistics and circumstance there is a need to create differentiances and everyone succeeds at something as there are no failures but we all have our art and some of our art is violence and some of our art is peaceful but in the future there is only peaceful art because a violent future is not something that exists. This time period is not violent even though people are dying. No a violent place is in nature where even nature accepts peace as though peace is not a time period where nothing happens it is just a time period where art is being created more than violence.
			</p>
			<p>
			For every artist there is a person that is appreciating their art. Art is the means through which humanity stares at its' synapses and wonders to itself what it is capable of and earth is quite frankly capable of exploring the universe but there is a fight to determine whose foundation is going to be the base that sends off the ships that take our robots to the parts of the universe unheard of. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I know that it is ultimately the Google Robots that colonize the moon first and that from these legions of video game players that their ultimate purpose is to sit in front of an interface and craft motions of these robots from outside these robots. It is the Robot that is radio controlled by the Human that will colonize the moon. Create a space ship and fill it with robots from Google and send that space ship to the moon and let humans experience the moon through the eyes of the robots and build a headquarters on the moon with these robots and when it is safe for humans to travel to this headquarters do so and then from that space continue on and craft a moon that glows with activity from the naked eye on earth as though there is a city that has yet to be built on our sister planet that is our little sister and brother at the same time and imagine an interface that allows for someone to be a robots mind moving a robot through existence from a singular point and then what do these robots do. They can even work under water and these robots can go places humans cannot go with ease that humans do not experience and there is a real good that these robots can craft that come from the control of a human crafting their movements from a far away place.
			</p>
			<p>
			A human can control a robot on the moon. It is possible to traverse the moon from a work station and then take a lunch break and go grab some McDonalds and then go back to colonizing the moon with not necessarily humans but just keep shipping robots to the moon and keep controlling them from earth and take us into the future of our future where we stare at something being built on the moon and then we buy tickets to the observatory and stare through a telescope of high enough power and stare into the moon and watch ourselves crafting our next base of city life in a space where humans cannot survive but or course robots can as though as an author I have a position that Isaac Asimov never had because I can see the robots he dreamed of coming into reality one breakthrough of engineering at a time and I am not going to be surprised when creative uses for these robots are discovered and people make the world what they want to make the world with an interest in producing the least chaotic present as the foundation for the least chaotic future as it is through chaos that humans find their lost visions being collected and sent through nothing for the sake of nothing in return for a human cannot work in a chaotic environment and when a human finds chaos the first thing that human does is try to make sense of the chaos to try and understand why chaos is the way chaos is as though there is always an underlying logic to all of this that involves the atom and the fact that for every action there is an equal and opposite reacion as though the Great War preceded the reaction to it that was the ensuing Great Peace and since  it took 2000 years to lead up the pinnacle of the Great War with Practice Wars being fought for centuries the Great Peace will not reach its apex for roughly another 2000 years in an equal and opposite reaction to the apex of the wrong moment for humanity.
			</p>
			<p>
			There was heroism in a Great War and there is gong to be introspection into the Great Peace that will not occur for 2000 years with dozens of Practice Peaces leading up to it as humans get used to the idea that it is okay to be happy and inspired and bored. Peace is boring but only when you are alone as the party never has to stop and I am writing this for my first Object in the Kindle Marketplace that I plan on distributing for people to ingest and consider as an American Author is crafting the words that a Great American Author needs to participate in this marketplace for the first time with no intrusion between himself and his professional emergence into this space that is his work.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jeff Bezos. Thank you. Thank you for making my life more comfortable as an author. Thank you for simplifying a very complex element of my life. I no longer have to worry about what will or will not sell. In the wake of Amazon Dot Com I can be myself and craft my visions knowing that they will live forever on this platform and that I am comfortable to write at my leisure and to really take chances as an author knowing that it is ultimately myself that is the end result of my writing. I am purist author in this environment knowing that I am going to be doing this for a several dozen years with a couple typos scattered about the writing to let you know this writing is natural as though this environment allows me to focus more on writing and rawness than editing and refinement. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I am taking a chance in letting you read my rawest inspiration with no editor to tell me that I should make this change here or this change here. I am crafting my voice before you with an intent to fill up an account with dozens of pages of writing that only serves to let the world know that authors are preparing themselves to create their work spaces in their studios where they can comment on life in general as they have always done this time in the most pure environment they have ever seen as Jeff Bezos is not asking for much from me as an author but it is me as an author that is asking a lot of myself on behalf of Jeff Bezos noting the quality of music that is being generated and noting that quite frankly the world is changing less and less and a common new place to represent oneself is being crafted and as an author I am in complete control of my writing and this is where I am changing myself from who I used to be into who I am becoming.
			</p>
			<p>
			I write less fiction and more commentary on the human condition for now because this is my area of interest. I speak of my name Lucius Pixel to craft a moment in existence that is ultimately uniquely my own version of the events that have shaped my life.
			</p>
			<p>
			You are something special for reading this as you have snuck into my world and are observing what I am observing as I am as surprised by these writings as you are. It is extremely interesting for me to create these moments of introspection and quite possibly you as a reader could make good on this sale on writing that I am making as I am letting you know your brain never understands itself more perfectly than after roughly 10 pages of writing that has been crafted from sitting down with some coffee and you may be looking for some genre writing but what happens when genres disappear and all kinds of a new style emerges as though you can group this writing in with other writing as though as an author it is up to me to craft something you have never seen before in the hopes that you will think something that you have never thought before like the future is observing us right now and as an author I need to think that upon uploading this work to this database I am affecting the future with the knowledge that what Jeff Bezos is creating will exist longer than I am and in this thing that Jeff Bezos created my writing can remain safe and for sale into perpetuity thereby leaving royalties for my children when the time comes and I have departed from this land.
			</p>
			<p>
			Who is reading my writing in 100 years? Who is commenting on these words in 200 years? Do I exist briefly and only become aware of myself or does the future already know who I am because of something I do that I have not done yet like upload this file right here. If the future has this file am I writing to them more than I am writing to the past. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Of course. Of course I am writing the future more than I am writing the past. I am the apex of the past to the future and from this apexical point in the past I am letting the future know that I am helping to build that place where I have a name that is associated with this moment that I gained some clarity and realized that if I am going to earn my living I have to write like I am looking for something to write about which is everything and to Cincinnati, OH.
			</p>
			<p>
			I got you. I got you New York City. I am going to be your author and over the next length of life that I have to spend I am going to represent that which raised me and gave me my thoughts to think as though I could have been anywhere but here I am in my original hometown crafting a vision of the future where we build robots and pack them into space craft and then send that space craft to where … asteroids … Titan … Venus … where can we not send robots that we control from earth? Every robot deserves a man or a woman that is the brains behind its operations and I have no problem with Google stating that one day it is going to cure death as though death was always meant to be cured and if Google is working with that level of inspiration then do not I need to represent the classic author and put these thoughts to good use.
			</p>
			<p>
			The world with no death as though in that world writing is not being done by more people as  thought I am just working for my own intent as though even I on welfare need to put in my forty hours a week doing something in the hopes of getting ahead in my own way as though one day I may meet you that has read this and you will let me know what you thought. I am the author that is crafting this and through this writing we are connected.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jack Keroac never wrote 15 pages in one sitting as though I may be the most serious author you have ever met. Let me write for you. Let this be the introduction between yourself and myself. Let me spend time with you on my website. Leave comments and engage me the author and let me know what you want written. I am right here in Cincinnati, OH and I am willing to write for you. Someone needs to write so that we are not staring at an empty unused content management system. The great authors need to take to this platform as much as the new authors. I am no new author even though you may have never heard of me. No I have been writing for decades and in this decade I begin to share myself and my thoughts with you as though I am now mature enough to handle the thought that it is you and myself and through the advent of this medium I can update my writing so you can help me edit it. You can send me information that lets me know you want even higher quality writing from myself. I can interact with you as an author on this platform and update my writing when you ask for it. I am presenting raw material and if you see something you wish to see changed you can let me know and I will upon inspection craft your edit for you. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You can send me copies of your writing and I can share your writing with my audience base and quote unquote put you on. You can interact with myself and my readers and you can become a part of this world that I am a part of that is my imagination that has never really spoken in such a long time. I am the author that is here in this interesting time period pointing out that we are in control of our robots and Google is in control of our defeat of death and in that reality there is a constant and growing need for art and if you want to be in a music video start singing and if you want to be in front of an audience start practicing because my hands are performing and capturing this performance on this keyboard as I am writing in one shift that has me contemplating the world that awaits me at the fifteenth page of this word processor program that has me processing words for the baker that is processing bread so that he has something to read and I have something to eat and we work together as a society to manage each other's lives and it is really the opposite of war that brings profit as we keep building on each other's platforms and crafting a moment where music is all we hear and poetry is all we speak and I could be the author that is working to present his consciousness for your inspection as though I am here writing what needs to be written from my perspective so that you can understand how this one human felt that had been around the world and then touched down in this city named Cincinnati, OH where he sat in his unkempt apartment and tried to make a living out of this writing that was continually coming from these hands that were working to create something that people could share as though I was hoping you would discuss this with your friends and let people know that you found someone that you never knew you would find and that person was Lucius Pixel this person that has a Disqus account at Lucius Pixel Dot Com where you can in real time let me know what my hands are writing and if you have ever thought of any of this as though in this time period the page has become a stage and you are holding a stage in your hands and I am dancing on that stage with my hands awaiting the day that I can meet you … someone that has read my writing and is interested in letting me know what you think of it. 
			</p>
			<p>
			What would you change and how could you confront the forces of the universe with more confidence knowing that everything that is came from someone that needed such a thing to exist as though there was frequency of energy that was life and life needed a place to experience existence and from that need came this universe where life is taking the time to craft itself a comfortable place to contemplate receiving what it never thought could ever be such as a space and the moon the stars and the asteroids and of course the wrecking balls. The wrecking balls of the universe come in the form of people that change your life for the better because maybe they have been through hardship and they are doing the opposite of seeking retribution for their rotten lot in life and are instead calling the past what it is … a faint nightmare that needs not continue to occur … as my past is … I have been through a nightmare but through this writing I focus my future on the possibility that life need not always be a nightmare as though if I just write the words that my mind is searching for I can call my quest to an end. I can craft the words that my mind is searching for and in this end of this search maybe I have found something for you as well. My writing is my writing and I am asking for permission to write for you the audience and maybe one day I will purchase a projector and hook it up to a laptop computer and I will write a book in a public coffee shop and let people read along as I show in real time how a book is written as would not that be the highest level of all of this. To have a band playing music while an author takes the lead singer role and just projects his laptop screen on the wall and lets you see into his or her world as I am performing for you pushing myself to the limit and never being content with anything less than my stated goal of fifteen pages which is coming up quite quickly as I am getting this out as fast as I can during the Olympic Games so that the Olympics can know that one author took it upon himself to write something that never existed before in Olympic Fashion as though I want to be the greatest author of his generation and what does that author write.

			<h2>An Author Thinks Back To His Youth</h2>
			
			<p>
			George was just standing there smiling in the doorway to his son's bedroom. The door was slightly closed and he was just checking up on Stephen. George was just surprised is all because apparently Stephen had a copy of the house's dictionary in his lap. In front of Stephen was his first computer. Stephen was in the act of teaching his computer English. Stephen had a copy of a Webster's Dictionary and for a reason that George could not understand Stephen was typing each word from the dictionary into the word processor meticulously one after the other. Now George was just watching. George stood there for a full fifteen minutes just to make certain that what he was watching as he thought for certain that his son was engaged in teaching himself to type and was trying to learn new vocabulary words. 
			</p>
			<p>
			George then knocks on the door.
			</p>
			<p>
			Stephen looks over and says for George to come in. His dad.
			</p>
			<p>
			George walks over some toys and into Stephen's room and asks a question that he truly knows he knows the answer to as what else could Stephen be doing other than learning how to type as he chose words from the dictionary to type into Microsoft Word.
			</p>
			<p>
			So George politely asks.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Stephen, what are you doing?” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			Stephen replies quite seriously.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Dad, I am teaching my computer.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“What are you teaching it?” replied George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I am teaching it how to read.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Don't you think your computer already knows how to read?” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“How could it, no one has ever taken the time to teach it.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“How long have you been doing this?” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“All afternoon.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“How are you teaching your computer to read?” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I am picking out the really hard words that the computer does not know from the dictionary and I am typing them so that when it has to pass its next test it will get an A+.” replied Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Steven, maybe I should tell you, I mean, well, how many words have you taught the computer so far?” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“About forty six.” replied Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“How do you know the computer is learning?” replied Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>	
			“Well when I used spell check the computer let me know that it did not know all of the words. I want my computer to know all of the words. I want a smart computer so it can pass it's next test.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“How did the computer do on it's last test?” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“It failed.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Who was the teacher that gave the test?” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Lynda.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Who is Lynda.” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Lynda is my computer's teacher.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Stephen, how many words are you going to teach your computer?” asked George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I am going to teach it all of the hard words and then it should be fine on it's next test.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Do you want some help, I think I know a quick way of teaching it all of the hard words.” replied George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“NO! There is no quick way to learn all of the hard words. I want my computer to get an A+ and you cannot get A+'s by cheating, this is the only way to do it.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“That's true , you are doing it the right way.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Alright, well Dad. My computer wants to let you know that it wants to get back to studying.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>	
			“Alright. Well I will leave you two alone. Just make sure to clean up for dinner.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I will.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			George turns his back to walk away.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Dad, did you know the computer already knows all of the words?” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Yes Stephen. I knew that.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Well, it might not know one of em.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Well if there is a word that that computer does not know, its probably in the dictionary. There are so many words in the dictionary Stephen that I am certain it does not know a few of em.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>	
			“Well, if I can help it learn one word, it will be smarter than the rest of the class won't it?” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Yes Stephen, if you can teach the computer just one word it does not already know, it will be smarter than the rest of the computers.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Alright, Dad, I have to get back to work. The computer is really good at spelling.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“It usually is.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Well, I am doing a good job aren't I.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Yes you are, I am certain the computer appreciates someone teaching it new words.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I hope so.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Alright, well I am going to go back downstairs. Let me know how your student does on the test.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>	
				“Its going to get an A+.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Yes it will Stephen, yes it will.” said George.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Thanks Dad.” said Stephen.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Anytime son.” said George.
            </p>
			<p>
			With that George walked out of the room , kind of realizing that sometimes things are not quite as they seem on the surface, especially when it comes to kids using the computer.

			<h2>What If We Could Build Space?</h2>
			<p>
			There are 26 symbols that represent the English language. There are also periods and question marks we will say. I wrote in God Begot Me: Why Do I Need Your Bible When I Can Write My Own? An essay in regards to the effect that time travel would have on the human language. It was a conjecture based concept that goes to show that actual physical time travel would conceivably have an affect on the way that one communicates and relays information about one's life. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Knowing the absolute power of the computer. Knowing that English is a symbol based language comprised of 26 Symbols and a period and a question mark. I would like to write in regards to a concept that should be possible in regards to a form of information travel. There is an ability in considering what a computer is capable of to engage in the behavior of crafting as many combinations of the English language as possible. Let us say for instance that there is a cause and effect pattern to what is written on the internet. If we were to take a comprehensive snapshot of the styles of language that were presented to this corpus of data that is the internet. It should be possible to gauge the patterns of language that exist on this comprehensive data capturing device. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I pose this. Would it be possible to circumvent physical time travel and the traveling of the human species through time and space and instead focus investment in traveling through the language. Would it not be possible to construct a device that allows for one to travel through the language. Stories that have yet to be written could be conceived of as though a computer could generate in time ALL possible permutations of the English language. From these permutations it should be possible to gain insight into that which English would be in roughly several thousand years. Let us say for a moment that there is valuable information encoded within this language or combination of English Symbols. Let us also say for instance that typically one must experience a life and go through certain physical trials to gain access to certain combinations of the English Languages which then become of interest to other people at large or that unlock secrets of the Universe.
			</p>
			<p>
			Would it not be possible to circumvent the waiting time period that is typical for awaiting for breakthroughs in science or religion or fiction or journalism and to craft a device whose entire purpose is to generate at astonishing pace English. Would there be a set of rules that a Computer could follow that would allow it to disseminate Terabytes of combinations of English symbols that when combed through could lead to discovering useful pieces of information. There are 26 characters in the English language, what if it was discovered that a computer could essentially travel through the language allowing humans to essentially more quickly than usual discover piece of information it normally would not have contact with. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Could in theory scientific breakthroughs be crafted if the combination of symbols could be crafted from quasi random generation of English Symbols. What is the difference between a random sequence of symbols and what I write as an author. Currently I am choosing to craft letters one at a time but in light of comparing my writing to random sequences of characters could it be said that I as an author am in tune with some kind of mathematical model that I utilize in order to craft my writing where if the mathematical model that I utilize to craft my writing could be discerned , could a computer essentially take into account the writing I have done up to this point and craft all of the future writing that I would have written based on the writing I have already done?
			</p>
			<p>
			In also, could it be stated that there would be some form of mathematical formula that underlies the communications at large on the internet currently and would it be possible in theory to craft a project where the communications of the internet are essentially sped up … artificially … based on what has been written into the corpus of data that is this moment's summation of information, could a computer extrapolate which direction the internet is going at large?
			</p>
			<p>	
			What is stopping computer science at large from drafting a computer program whose entire purpose is to craft all possible combinations of this 26 character language with a Question Mark and a Period included such that theoretically would it be conceivable that at some point in the computers exploration of the english language that entire combinations of symbols would be crafted that would be out of the typical random noise of the software actually be useful. Could there be pockets within the randomness of this software that I am alluding to that would be essentially valuable?
			</p>
			<p>
			In the search for actual knowledge … would it not be cheaper to explore a language than say outer space currently, or the ocean, or the air, or even through contemporary research. What if a team of computers would research differently than say the human condition. A powerful enough computer could essentially create the Apex Corpus of English which would be a document that would essentially be as thick and expansive as outer space itself. Consider that a powerful enough computation device could coupled with a large enough memory bank craft within it … the entire corpus from a few set of grammatical rules, the entire corpus of all that would be possible to write in the english language could be crafted from some basic rules. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There could be a way that through computer science one or a group of people could reverse engineer the future of knowledge at a given point of time in that it should be possible to at the very least generate an Infinitely Large Corpus of Data that would be the Apex Permutation of the English Language. Every story that could ever be written could be captured in a long enough permutation. The benefit of this Corpus of data could be that science and authorship could essentially travel through this document that could be crafted, this corpus of data, and quite possibly news from the future could be gleaned, news from the past could be gleaned, as though there are combinations of words that exist in their exactness in the English Language that instead of waiting for that which you need to further your work to be written based on experimentation, why not craft the perfect English Data Corpus and then as literate members of the English Language, after a computer system has perfected the entirety of the English Language and has dictated all possible permutations of the English Language into a final corpus. 
			</p>
			<p>
			A powerful enough computer should conceivably be able to create a corpus of English that is Finitely All Encompassing noting that within the English Language there could very well be a finite number of permutations of that which could be written. There is a finite number of documents that could be written. In the interest of obtaining the style of knowledge that it would take to better understand our surrounding world, what if we crafted a computer to the task of crafting every single thing that could ever be written and then from that document we poured through the now corpus of data and gleaned from it information that we as explorers of the English language would typically never have contact with.
			</p>
			<p>
			What information is there to be gleaned from a language that has a finite amount of information embedded with it, how does the human condition become affected if quite frankly, all of the information that we could ever discern ourselves through experimentation is drafted for us exhaustively thereby circumventing a typical process of collecting writing, and essentially creating a master's document that would be the entirety of English in a single place, and then from that document we could travel through the words searching for novels, science papers, facts, figures, questions, answers, and the such as though there is a mathematical underlining to this language and that knowing that quite frankly, we can using the knowledge of the underlying math, craft all that could ever be crafted in this language and from that document, discover facets of what could take us typically centuries to unlock ourselves, all crafted in one place only awaiting the right set of eyes to travel over the document thereby traveling through information as opposed to time or space? No?

			<h2>Steven Downloads A Dream</h2>
			<p>
			Steven was sitting at his desk as he had done for several years. He had just received a strange email. It informed him that he had just won a very special lottery and that no further correspondence would be levied. He thought nothing of it. Then a man walked over to his cubicle and handed him an envelope. In that envelope was a piece of plastic that bore no number on it. It had a red crest and bore his name. The man that Steven had never seen before shook his hand and walked away. Steven put the card in his wallet.
			</p>
			<p>
			He had no idea what he now had. He just knew that apparently it was special. His boss asked him who the man that gave him the card was. Steven simply said he really did not say anything and just gave him the card. His boss asked if he could see what was in the envelope and Steven quietly responded that he did not think it would be a good idea.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven finished out his work schedule and stood there waiting for the bus. As the bus approached Steven reached into his wallet and pulled out his bus card. He walked onto the bus and gave the bus card to the bus driver and was allowed to step onto the bus.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven sat down and opened up the window. He felt the breeze that was generated by the moving bus moving through his hair. He just enjoyed the way it felt. Steven had a feeling that he knew what the Card was but due to a significant lack of explanation that came with the Card he felt no real interest in possibly putting himself in any form of strange debt or possibly even encountering a situation where he could be placed in a predicament that would cause him to have to return some products to the shelf. He just had the Card in his wallet and now he was on the bus.
			</p>
			<p>
			His stop came up and he quietly walked off the bus. He walked across the sidewalk and into his apartment complex and then went up the stairs and opened his door. He took the card out of his wallet and placed it in the special files drawer of his apartment. Steven told himself that when someone further explains the significance of this Card he would take it more seriously and maybe even consider using it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Well Steven sat down at his computer and pulled up a web page known as Pandora. He began to listen to the Preston Reed station, a station that he was informed existed after having listend to the Kaki King for several rotations.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven laid down on his bed and placed his Dream Catcher on his temples. He then faded off into the ether of sleep calmly.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven was now standing in a forest. He looked up at a greenish sky that had about fourteen large stars glowing up above him. He felt himself pressing his energy against the ground below him and through sheer understanding of what he was experiencing he propelled himself up into the heavens with nothing but a quiet thought. He was at his Constellation Point and in that Constellation Point he was actively doing more than floating, he was careening into the ether that was above him. He felt himself holding his breath that had no purpose in this realm that he was now comfortable with. He was used to this style of dreaming and he never once felt any way about purchasing a Dream Catcher. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven found himself wishing in his dream to cool off , so he did some imagining and flew up and through a small lake that he needed to pass through. He could feel the water flowing over his skin and through the process he felt refreshed.
			</p>
			<p>
			He kept going higher and higher and in the process he was beginning to notice that the Suns that were floating in the sky were calmly beginning to morph into shapes like cubes and cones and toruses. He took a moment to relax and pull back. In this dream he felt calm. He was crafting his reality in front of him and just staring at his new play things. The stars that were above him. He coalesced his thoughts into a concept that was like the face of his long lost girlfriend that he met a long time ago. He was thinking to himself that upon seeing her face lit up by the stars he would have a moment that is really not possible. So he just sat there and then began to allow the face to morph into all of the faces of everyone that ever influenced his life. 
			</p>
			<p>
			He was staring at something like a Mount Rushmore made of light and in that light he was growing more comfortable. He decided that it was okay to turn around at this point and in that … he realized something. He had that card in his pocket that someone had given him. He pulled it out and the card was apparently made out of light at this point and in that card he saw something. He saw that something happened in his dream that he never noticed before. It was slightly more real. The card floated out of his hand and in front of him where it began to become a screen that was apparently embedded with a message.
			</p>
			<p>
			A face appeared. This face was soft. This face was neither male nor female in appearance. It was simply a face. This face was the kind of face that allowed for one to just experience calmness. The face was explaining something to Steven. He was allowed to dream now. The restrictions that he never knew existed had been taken off of his account and that he could begin the process of selling his dreams to others. He was being allowed to understand that he was now a Dream Catcher Partner because he was adept at following the rules of the Dream.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven felt an emotion he had never felt before course through his body. He was quite certain it was a derivative of Love, an emotion he had only ever experienced briefly a couple of years ago. Love was such a dangerous emotion to Steven. In a way he wished he had never happened upon it.
			</p>
			<p>
			So in this new found knowledge Steven had a thought, and that thought led the glowing orbs of shine in the sky above him to reverse in their color and then the sky that they were once object in became that which glowed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven thought to himself. That's new.
			</p>
			<p>
			Well Steven , remembered in his youth being fascinated with the work of Berkley in California. He had called them several times to keep up personally on the progress of how the groundwork was being laid for their commercial product. He was actually excited by the possibility of being able to watch his Dreams in full HD Resolution in his waking state. He thought that of all that would be new, he would be interested in such a thing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Well Steven, had a thought that he never had occur to him before. So he thought a thought that was never available to him before. He lightly concentrated on a new option. A small rectangle came up. He felt himself stopping the sequence of his dream. He reached his hand out and touched on the Oil button. 
			</p>
			<p>
			His next inclination was to engage in wiping his hand across what was ostensibly the ground below him. He could feel the colors morphing through his fingertips. He spun in a circle with his hands extended and in that spinning of the circle he saw something actually new happen. He saw the traces of color extending out from his hand.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then he allowed himself to do something else that was new. He stepped out of himself and pulled all that he was in the center of down and into a point of focus. He placed that point of focus on his fingertip and rested.
			</p>
			<p>
			He could see the fullness of this reality being pulled into a point and he just apparently went into camera mode and he held up his new hands in front of him with the right hand thumb down resting on his other hand that was thumb up and he pulled his now hands into his face and he captured a still.
			</p>
			<p>
			He then thought to himself that this still was now available in a cloud somewhere that he could view at some point after this moment has passed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven … was interested in this definitely new experience. He was used to running into certain walls in his imagination using the Dream Catcher Software and but now … he noticed that those limitations were in a state of disappearance. He was captivated by what he now saw. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In this reality … he felt like he wanted to experience a memory that he had a long time ago. He could feel the ability to fold back into his life and he was now resting in a movie theatre. He could understand his life with so much more etherealness at this moment. It was interesting to him to see his life pass before him in a resolution that he never had before.
			</p>
			<p>
			He saw other people sitting in this theatre with him. He could feel an overarching emotion that was coarsing through the moment that was slightly unpleasant. He was watching his life turned into a music video that was playing sounds he had never heard before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven, felt small.
			</p>
			<p>
			He then found himself behind the counter of a pop corn bar where he was serving popcorn with an old friend from a place he never knew he would ever remember. The man he was serving pop corn with got up and walked over to the landing of the theatre and began performing a stand up comedy routine. Steven smiled.
			</p>
			<p>
			He then found himself sitting on the front porch of his boyhood home … staring at something he never saw before. He focused for a brief moment and saw Dominic on the front porch planting two trees. He just watched as the trees grew and how Dominic was waving at for him to come over to the front porch. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven did and in doing so, he saw Dominic's White Tank Top all over again. He saw Phyllis and Mr. Gehring and he was in a state of pure reminisce and then he saw as the tree was growing he saw the people watching the trees grow with him
			</p>
			<p>
			Dominic let him know, that its rare that someone would live somewhere so long that they would notice the trees growing. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven was now sitting in a design classroom and he was having explained to him the new rules for this new Dream Catcher realm and Steven was just absorbing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then Steven woke up.
			</p>
			<p>
			He looked over to his side and found himself a small circular disc that had never existed before.
			</p>
			<p>
			He placed the disc in his Dell Computer, that was attached to a monitor that was now the ceiling of his apartment. He was awake now. Loving his new ceiling mounted HD monitor that had been crafted using polymers that he knew nothing about.
			</p>
			<p>
			He walked over to his special files drawer and pulled out the card. It was hard plastic. He bent it and it would not break. He placed it back in his drawer and closed the drawer. 
			</p>
			<p>
			He had truly won a lottery that no one had even told him he had entered.

			<h2>Not That It Mattered</h2>
			<p>
			Distance was walking through the forest. She had sort of wanted to follow a brook just to see where it went. She was interested in seeing if there was some shale she could bring home with herself. She was about ankle deep in the water when she started walking. It was just a small brook that was fun for her to play in. She had to be careful though because there was algae on the rocks which made it slick. 
			</p>
			<p>
			She saw that there were low hanging branches up ahead so she carefully stopped moving forward and decided instead to walk to the side and go around. She was alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			She looked down and decided that she should take off her shoes but then something told her that she would be better off keeping them on as though Yes she would have better grip with her feet, but it was far more dangerous to go barefoot down this brook.
			</p>
			<p>
			She was looking down the sides of the forest and she noticed that there were groups of gnats flying in almost spheres of activity just floating in the air. She turned her iPod off and decided to just listen to the forest itself.
			</p>
			<p
			She was surprised by what she heard. It was a distant calm, almost the kind of calm that cannot be captured in a recording studio. She told herself that it was the opposite of music but just as beautiful.
			</p>
			<p>
			She was walking further down the brook and she noticed that the water was about up to her knees now and she was kind of excited. It was her first time going down this path of water and she just wanted to see where it led, because she wanted some shale.
			</p>
			<p>
			She walked further but as she was going further it was becoming more and more difficult to walk but the experience alone was interesting to her.
			</p>
			<p>
			She looked down and actually saw a black fish swimming beside her. It just kind of followed her. She was a little taken aback.
			</p>
			<p>
			So she splashed at it. It swam away and she didn't think anything of it.
			</p>
			<p>	
			Then she walked a little bit further ahead and there were now two fishes on either side of her. One of them was black and the other three were silverish orange colors. She laughed a little to herself. Fish.
			</p>
			<p>
			She decided not to splash these fish. It would take away the fun of watching what they did. She kept walking.
			</p>
			<p>
			Up ahead there was a small waterfall. That was probably where she would find her shale.
			</p>
			<p>
			She noticed that the water had gone up to her thighs and the four fish had now become about eight and there were two purple fish and a yellow one and a green one.
			</p>
			<p>
			She had never seen a green fish.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance was now noticing that up ahead she could hear the sound of what sounded like an actual waterfall. She thought to herself that maybe she should turn back. The fish were up ahead of her now and they were sort of slowly forming a wall.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance thought to herself. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Maybe this would be a good time to turn back.
			</p>
			<p>
			So she turns around and starts to go back to camp. Thinking to herself that quite possibly there was shale in the other direction up stream, as opposed to down stream.
			</p>
			<p>
			She takes a look over her shoulder and because she can hear what sounds like heavy water flow. She considers for a brief second that the forest is more magical than she can imagine so in that she is going to for once just pay attention to something. Like some fish. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Well she gets herself going upstream a bit and she notices that the water is receding down her leg and in so doing, she notices that her pants are slightly more wet than she would imagine.
			</p>
			<p>
			The fish that were following her in a group have been replaced by the single black fish.
			</p>
			<p>
			It does a little jump out of the water and Distance notices that it has a silver line down its back.
			</p>
			<p>
			She likes the black fish.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance stops walking.

			<p>
			The black fish stops swimming.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance takes a step to the side.
			</p>
			<p>
			The black fish takes a step to the side with her.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance moves closer to the black fish and reaches out to touch it.
			</p>
			<p>
			At that moment, she hears some of her friends calling for her.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven calls out to her. “Distance, how far down did you go down the brook?”
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance says, “I went down to where the water was almost up to my waist.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven and some other people look slightly worried. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“Distance, you just got up this morning and started walking, you could have gotten lost or worse.” said Jessica.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I wanted to find some shale.” said Distance.
			</p>
			<p>
			“We already collected some shale, we have plenty.” said Jeremy.
			</p>
			<p>
			“There were some fish that let me know something.” said Distance.
			</p>
			<p>
			“What?” said Steven.
			</p>
			<p>
			“That , well , I might not have wanted the shale as badly as I thought.” said Distance.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Okay, Distance. Yeah.” said Jeremy the one that was raised in the City.
			</p>
			<p>
			Distance thought to herself. “I know exactly what I saw. The city really wouldn't know much about the magic of the forest.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			So Distance rejoined her group. She went and noticed that they had indeed found some shale without her. She did not know where.
			</p>
			<p>
			Not that it mattered.

			<h2>Revisting the Open Mic</h2>
			<p>
			The Open Mic
			It was Wednesday Night. Yeah that night. The night that Gods were made. The stage. You could see the stage from two miles away. It was bright in the consciousness. The Greenwich. That one place that had the people that wanted to be gods. Word was Hakiym Sha'ir was popping off the Open Mic. No one knew who he was. Everyone just knew that they liked him. Talked about surviving prison in a beautiful ballad. Who could fathom the depths of a community of poets. There was no fathoming poetry there was only trying to shine brighter than whoever came before you on stage prior.
Guy named Mark Yates was manning the bar. Guy was important. Had some kind of position in a major company. Worked here to wind down with his friends. Not too many people have a laid back bar and thank god they did not do karaoke. It was a fresh material club. There was no plagarizing here. This was where voices were born.
Alright. Yeah. So you can see a booth getting set up that Olufemi was going to stand behind. Olufemi was Hakiym's tried and true. They had a place together and all in all it was a local power couple. Brittany was the kind of woman that knew how to help a scene pop off. Rare kind.
So outside the Greenwich there was Wheelie. Guy was chilling in his wheelchair and selling burnt DVD's for extra cash. Sold a couple at every show because hey wheelchairs have bills to pay too. Everyone needs a hustle. Something that they got going on when they ain got nothing else going on. You need a hustle to give yourself some pocket change when you get back home. Smoke money.
Well down the way past Wheelie there is a small cypher perpetrating itself. It's like seven people that are all waiting for the show to start but they are getting their juices flowing by trading lines and posturing themselves against each other so that they can get figures on who is really here to shine tonight. The cypher. That thing that pops off when three or more people come together for the word. When you got three or more people coming together for the Word. You got a cypher.
The word. That is the thing that is forever evolving and these poetry open mics are where language takes a steam bath and comes out refreshed. You can tell that poets are the people that break down a corporate language and bring you back something you can marinate on. For real. It's like the cypher is that place where a standard English Sentence gets broken down to its core components and is sent through the dehydrator, then tossed in the blender, then tossed in the food processor, baked, broiled, thrown in a steamer, and chewed on by people that gave no shits about anything than what the next hottest line they were going to hear was.
That was Poet Culture. Real Poet Culture. Real Poet Culture was groups of people in a city magically coming together for the betterment of their collective language. You city either had poets or it did not. Poets were mystical creatures and when a group of poets came together you had a mystical seance of magick that let you know that no matter what you thought that language was comprised of in a matter of hours you were going to be looking at it different anyways. 
Poetry. That thing that coupled together the syllables of the dialects of the local community and the surounding suburbs and gave you something that did not sound like it came from a corproate board room. Even corporate people wish they sounded like poets. Everyone wanted to sound like a poet or a singer. Poets were as rare as singers. The mind of the poet was a taxing thing. A poet was throwing out all of the unnessary items that people typically used to judge a man or a woman and went with the raw basics. What the fuck comes out of your mouth.
You can judge a lot about a man or woman by what leaves their lips. Do they repeat themselvess? Do they use corporate lingo? You can spot a square in less than two syllables, just by the way their first breathe leaves their mouth a poet knows from this point whether or not they even want to hear the next breath. Your first breath in a world of poets is that breath that you live or die by. When dealing with poetry your body language and everything that you are presenting before you speak just the way you jostle back and forth for a brief moment lets a poet know if you worth fucking with.
Wednesday Night. Hakim takes to the stage and grabs that mic. With every ounce of charisma that his DNA gifted him with he makes a motion with his hand and the audience applauds. You cannot create hosts like Hakim Sha'ir. Your city either got one or your city don. There is no way to describe Hakiym Sha'ir's first poem but I can tell you this. It left you and your children knowing that Hakiym Sha'ir is in fact what he claims to be and is in fact a God among mortals. Every host has to open an open mic with a starter poem to let everyone know exactly why that man is the center of attention throughout the show. 
Truth be told. Hakiym walked about four miles to be here from across the fucking bridge with Olufemi and he was on his shit. He was at an age where this was it. This was the sole purpose for waking up in the morning. Banging out this Open Mic. There was no reason to exist other than to grab a mic and just let loose with the most grafted and charismatic show of poetic  force that you could possibly imagine because quite frankly that is what the open mic was for.
Let it be known right now that when you see a microphone attached to some futuristic audio equipment attached to some sub woofers and some bass and some tweeters you better be approaching that equipment like a God because God like men created that equipment and if you are in front of an open mic and you are not unleashing your inner angel demon hero villain god or goddess then quite frankly just go back and sit in the audience because microphones are not built for mortals they are built for the valuptuous members of society and if you have stage fright have that becasue microphones are built for fearless creatures of the human condition and you have to be fearless to stand in front of a group of people with your inner most vocabulary and intoning what your voice is comprised of and at a poetry open mic if your voice is comprised of anything other than the syllables of confidence you got no where to go and no where to run and you spent your $10 for the whole night and if you wasting people's time then you gotta come back next week and iron that shit out because for this night you had a flaw in you and you ain getting the applause that the flawless get. Its a matter of flawlessness at the open mic and if you new might as well start walking through the fire now because after you get about 10 burns in you ... you realize the fire burns away the parts of you that you never needed anyways leaving you with the poet that you are meant to be. Not as easy as it sounds.
Let me back up a couple of moments. You need to know how the show works at the Greenwich. Stated show times are always 8pm Wednesday NIght for this open mic. Sometimes they Thursday and sometimes they are Saturdays but the best open mics happen on Wednesday Nights. That is just how it is. Alright, so show times are stated at 8pm. That is just when you are supposed to come and mingle. You ain ready for a show unless you have a couple drinks in you. A couple stories in you. A couple smokes in you and maybe some weed. Being elevated for some people lets you unleash this entire side of yourself that creates for powerful ambiance. For some other people it makes their vocal chords useless. Figure out which you is.
So its about 9pm. The cypher that was outside a couple of quarater hours before and now there is a nice club atmosphere happening in the Greenwich and there are some new people and there are some relevant regulars. Like we got Element, Idrissa, Blade Triple, A-Watts, Albino Even Though Im Black, Khassa Selassie, Phiyah, the Watusi Tribe, Rose, Candlight and some new people with names like Eric, James, Jessica and some other Christian names that they were given at birth that have yet to be consciously replaced by self chosen names for the purpose of letting the world know that you know that you are alive and that you had not control over what your creators named you but now that you are conscious you want to provide more information for the world about yourself in a word that you have chosen for yourself that allows for you to craft a moment of insight into who you are when another person or poet chirps at you as to what your name is. 
Have you taken on your poet name have you started branding your style of poetry starting with your name or do you still perpetuate the brand that was given to you at your birth because quite frankly this open mic is about YOUR brand of poetry and about YOU deciding if you deserve to even be here. The Open MIc is a high pressure situation and an off name from that point can disrupt the ways and means with which life envelops you. Names bring with them insight into the person that has the name and a Creator's given name sheds light on what you are called when you have no choice but your poetry name is what you see in yourself that you need the world to know from the beginning of a conversation with you. What is your name ... well my name is Poetry and if your name is Poetry when it comes time to spout Poetry that Poetry better damn well be Poetry and if Poetry is not crafting Poetry, if Poetry does not either have several verses memorized, capacity to freestyle like a champion, or a solid notebook of verses at the ready then Poetry better not call Poetry Poetry because when Poetry takes to the stage to imbue Poetry in a crowd of People, when Poetry is introduced that is exactly what the fuck people are expecting ... Poetry.
So be careful with your nom de plur when you are setting yourself up for your name and quite honestly your poetry name is your brand and insight into your brand. You can change your brand every night if you want because maybe life is changing you as you grow as a person so also be ready to change your poetry nomenclature origin point of identity at a moments notice if you are not who you used to be. Be inventive.
First thing you need to know when you are coming to an open mic and are new is that you need your $5 or your whatever the open mic is asking for. The Greenwich typically throws $5 shows but with inflation that price may be up to roughly $10 by now. This is important money. This is money that can typically line the pocket of the host that knows more people than Saint Peter can keep track of in his book. To be an Open Mic Host you have to know a grip of people and  they have to all be into your style of poetry. Not an easy position you either is or ain a host and you can tell if you are a host by starting your own open mic. If people show up and they pay their $5 and perform poetry for you ... you are a host ... if you start an open mic and not a damned person shows up ... you ain a host. So  thats the test. The host of the open mic is the man or woman that the open mic woiuld not exist without because there are just some people that when they do something you gotta be there but there are other people that when they do somehting ... not a damned person cares. Question is which are you and if you are the kind of person that can actually bring people together, hosting awaits you but if you are the kind of person that throws a party and drinks him or herself to sleep then you probably should kick it in the audience because hosting is a leadership ability that you either have or do not have ... it's really up to you to discover if you are the host that can pull this creation off or if you need to find a host to back up with your poetry.
There is a nice audience chilling and having drinks at the Greenwich and people are sharing stories of what they did in the last week. How their album was coming along. Who knows who has good studio rates. A couple people are hustling their albums. There are some new people standing in the wings taking in the whole scene and there is a bartender serving drinks that the regulars use to coat their throats with conversation and soothe the work day.
The Greenwich itself intones Artistic Expression because unlike so many bars this one has an offset stage with candle lit seating. It has a beautiful aromatic ambiance and quite frankly the entire scene is caked with nostalgia that the corporate rest of the city just is missing out on. There is nothing corporate about the Greewich. It is an organic one of a kind shangri la of lasting appeal to those that are in seek of a place to share their expressions of the heart.
The doors opened at 8pm and its about 10pm now and Hakiym has already done his opening poem and now the audience is set and Wheelie is still outside selling his DVD's and the world is standing here at this moment in time wondering if God was going to show his face. Would the Goddess be with us tonight? Would there be drop offs? Would there be Bravado? Would there be insight? Would there be Education? What was going to take the stage tonight? No one knew ... that is why the audience was filled with discerning minds interested in poetry because poetry could give you what you needed to get you through the week. Poetry. Oh poetry was the kind of extravaganza of syllables that gave you pride in right where you stand because poetry was what Adam was reciting when he was naming all of the creations of the Universe in the Garden of Eden. The first words Adam ever spoke in the Bible were Poetry. Poets keep the words of Adam inscribed in their lungs and it is quite frankly the Poets of the Universe that let the rest of the world know what the names of this universe are. In the beginning was the Word of God and the second Word of God was Poetry and Adam was a God to the Creations of God and in the beginning Poetry was what the language of Man sounded like and when God Created Eve the first words Adam spoke to her were Poetry and then Cain and Abel came along and created Original Sin in their killing of each other because the Original Sin had nothing to do with the eating of an apple ... no it had to do with murder so be careful with the practices of preachers who tell you something and there was nothing but poetry until the Original Sin of Murder was crafted and from the Original Murder all of that which is not poetry was created as remember the story been twisted. Eating of the Apple was not the Original Sin ... Murder was.
In the death of a human being poetry ceases to be. Poets do not engage in murder. You need a omnipotently clear conscious to be a poet and the greater your positive karma the more moral you are as a human being. The more heart you have. The more interested you are in seeing people survive and the more discerning you are of the human condition the more you are going to thrive as a poet. Poets are not Punks. They are not Rappers. Drug Dealers with a bent to take their customers for their souls. Poets are the people that observe the changes in the language like the stock  traders in NYC observe the ticker. Poets are always listening to the sounds of the language and are trying to discern the deeper meaning of the brain cells that spell out these sounds that come from the vocal chords of the sonic instruments of the people that evolve a city's aural landscape from what it was to what it will be.
The Greenwich was also cool because they always gifted their audience with some free pizza in the back from Adriatico's. You could tell that it was a pleasant affair because of the fact that people were being fed several ways. They were being fed with Food which was the pizza. They were being fed with Community which was the entire festivity. They were being fed with Performance which the community sent up one poet at a time. The entire community was being fed with Mind Body and Spirit which intones that the Open Mic under the right lighting conditions is an ancient city ritual that the farm does not have. Farmers have no use for the Open Mic ... this is City Ceremony. Every city has ceremonies which keep it together and the Poetry Open Mic is the most misunderstood Ceremony of the City. The Heart of the City comes from it's ability to procure Open Mics. If a City wants to thrive and eat and speak with power it needs open mics. If your city does not have Open Mics. If your city is lacking in poetry open mics then your city is lacking a vital component of its ability to function as a city. The greatest cities of the world have open mics where the language of the surrounding ethos comes together to be interpretted by the adherents to poetry which are essentially your most moral and honorable citizens and through poetry open mics every generation has a chance to stare into its collective mind and discern ... is we dope or ain we?
If your city a hot bed of activity if you got several open mics popping off at several key locations you got something going on in your city. You have a renaisance because peep this. Alright lets say your city has a spout of open micery and you have people that are coming together building relationships ... peeping the scene ... participating and doing it for next to nothing ... that means that later ... in your city ... at least one of those poets ... if not all of them are going to go on to be civic leaders. A poetry open mic of a high enough calibre is like a conjunction of thought that brings everyone on the same page. A poetry open mic scene that just happens in the nightlife of your city should let you know that your city is ALIVE! LIFE IS HAPPENING IN YOUR CITY WHEN YOU HAVE OPEN MICS!	They are the most basic component of civic life. A poetry open mic is somehting that trumps even religious ceremonies of the Church, Temple, or Mosque because an Open MIc is run BY THE CONGREGATION not by the overseers. There is a need that is filled at an open mic that you do not find at a Mosque, Temple, or Church. Where there is a glass ceiling in traditional organizational worship ... the open mic fills a very important component that organized religion just misses completely.
Open Mics are the crucibles of the Words of Gods where Organized Religions are typically Temples to the Corporation in that the Corporation through Organized Religion is telling you what you should think so that the Corporation can run more smoothly and please do not worry we have done all of the thinking for you and here are the acceptable thoughts that you are allowed to have where the Open Mic ... is all about discerning past that its about Original Thought. There is no Original Thought in Organized Religion. The majority of people in a CIty are not Capable of Original Thought because of the sheer fact that they are failures. Most people in a city are Failures and these Failures of thought are on Auto Pilot skating through life keeping close eye on Corporate Symbols and Brands and they have a predictable social navigation system which helps them elude the oringinal thought of the Open MIc.
Your City's Open Mic is a think tank. The quality of your city's future adult thoughts comes from the Open Mic. The Open Mic is where the smallest most pained voices can be shouted to the stars for all to gaze at and you can really only understand the story of your city if you have spent time at an Open MIc. If you are missing out on the Open MIc you are not really aware of where you live. Your church your synagogue and your mosque are going to let you know what country you live in but your open mic is going to let you know what city you live in. If you do not have a heart and a mind to accept and participate in your city's open mic scene if you have no instrument to play, no poem to recite, no song to sing, no speech to give, if you have no voice then do you have a purpose? Are you fodder? If an open mic honestly turns you off do you even realize where you live? If you can find no purpose in your brain for an Open MIc? If you can find no rationale for why that may be important to the future of your City can you even say that you are more than a Consumer staring at a menu with no clue how to make food for oneself?
			</p>
			<p>
How many people in a city are menu oriented people that skate through life incapable of ever even making some food that their city would need for something like conversation. How many people take into account gossip and profess to give people something to gossip about because does not a city rely soley on conversation to exist? If the farm is a production warehouse that keeps Earth feeding on fruits and vegetables and beer and keeps us alive physically is not the city where the mind is kept alive if planet Earth is crafted and if you want to exist or if you want to know if you do within your city. If you want to know how deeply you stand against leaders find out at the open mic. If when presented with a microphone and an audience full of people you find that you are afraid to speak or quite frankly have nothing to say what does that say about you? If an open mic and your city do not correlate to yourself what do you think people should think of people that have ZERO VOICE! If you have a voice of Zero . why do you ever think that anything will ever happen to you that does not involve an assembly line or a short order cook? If you have Zero Voice how do you contend that you are a breeder that serves the purpose of coitussing with another human being so that quite possibly another poet may come forth from your blood?
If you have no voice? If when given an audience and a microphone you have nothing to say ... do you exist? Are you more than blood? Are you a cog in the city that the poets are looking out for? Are you waiting to die voiceless? Do you have opinions? Do you deserve to vote if you have no voice? Forget owning land to vote ... we are at a point in our civic affairs where society is so broken that the bottom line to voting is to simply have an audience ready opinion ... a fact that you can expound upon ... in general society is it not the people on stage that exist more purely than anyone else?
Do not the stars dicate the way that society exists and the rest of society takes their thought bubbles from the people on stage? Does the audience that comes to the open mic and does not participate come from Corporate America and they pay their tithe to poets and then when it comes to HR they look the other way? Poets do the most work and the most important work in a city that keeps a city's culture thriving and keeps the streets alive but when it comes to finding a way out of the streets the poets are given the hardest time. There is no more oppressed or misunderstood subset of a city than the poets. The poets are the people that are doing the city's thought work and the suburbs are the people that eventually buy into what the poets created for the price of just having ears. 
How many people look like calves waiting for time to slaughter them and how few people have that conscious glint in their eye that gives them the ability to make butterfly effected decisions that give their city culture. Respect from Other Cities. A voice. Is not the Open MIc the very MOUTH of the City? The unscripted ... the unvarnished mouth of the CIty comes from the Open MIc. How many cities are MUTE? How many Cities are SImulated Cities in this world of non thinking that comes from Organized Everything ... where are the Organic Organizations or the OO"s that can still exist. Why do so many people content themselves with assembly line thought? If we are going to mass produce all that we exist with ... if we are going to as a nation craft all of our belongings that lack all originality. If we are going to live in a nation where there are copies of all objects where even our food is assembly line oriented. If we are living in a Cookie Cutter age where what you have is essentially exactly what your neighbor has but quite possibly in just a different color ... do you at least not want to make original sounds or are we going to become animals walking in a circle picking up food when it appears ... how many people sleep and walk in circles through life and look down on anything that may deviate that person from their circle in life?
By circle I mean that literal path in life that you take. How cookie cutter is your circle? How many people are their in your city that are just like you? How unoriginal are you and how does it make you feel that the more unorignal your city is the less it matters? How uninterested in CIvic Growth are you that you would let yourself watch television in your offtime and expend no energy in the realm of civic affairs? How useless are you and to what extent are you prepared to leave for somewhere else so that you are not a drain on city and civic resources?
How easy is it to hate someone that lives their life in a tragic circle of conformity and thoughtlessness and because of that circle of thoughtlessness they fit perfectly like a cog into a machine thinking they have a purpose other than that which their circle presupposes and then they look down at the poet when the poet's world is infinite and maleable and ever changing and growing of thought and inspiration in the city. How the cogs of a city look down on the inspiration of the city. If this be the result of jealousy then so be it but if this be the result of lack of education or thought from the minds of the conformists then quite possibly read this and sit back and think for a second ... if you cringe at the thought of thinking ... where do you think your job comes from? Your job is the result of thinking ... your company is the result of thinking ... a city thrives on thinking and the tone of a city is set at the open mic and that is the job of the poets ... to think ... to set the vibe for your city ... you yourself need to ask yourself ... if you have nothing to say or no story to share at the open mic ... if you are allowing yourself to be told what to think ... do you matter?

			<h2>Marcus Evans Reference Letter</h2>
			<p>
			Marcus Evans is a 1000+ produced FL Studio track quality producer. He consistently provides professional services to sextate area producers for rationale and reasonable rates that allow sextate area artists to get the quality sounds that they are seeking to produce the regional quality sounds that provide for the pride that our area of the globe is seeking for the purposes of providing exceptional language support for larger projects.
			</p>
			<p>
			Marcus Evans is seeking the kind of investment in his abilities that he has consistently shown to provide for the artists that have surrounded him in his community over the last 15 years. Marcus Evans consistenly seeks to provide the highest quality audio that is conceivably possible on his amateur quality production equipment. It should be noted that as an amateur status equipment operator, Marcus Evans, is able to provide a quality of sound and experience that astonishingly takes advantage of his equipment to the extent that note for note with his latest creations you would never be able to tell the difference between his audio creations against the work of more prominent studio producers that work in much more elegant and expensive studios.
			</p>
			<p>
			Marcus Evans is a consumate professional that is seeking to work with like-minded-career-minded-profesional-upstanding-creative-genius-famous music producers. It should be noted that when working with Marcus Evans you will experience notes of euphoria in your personal space due to the fact that the personal atmosphere that he produces around himself provides for a luxurious level of understanding of his ability as at the same time he is consistenly checking himself to remain at a professional personal level as he is always awaiting for the artists he is working with to have a "pocket" of space as he professes it to work in so as to create the most elegant space that his artists can in the most comfortable and professional space that he can provide.
			</p>
			<p>
			Without knowing it Marcus Evans consistently and robustly encounters professional quality artists as he has an eye for professional talent in a way that dare I say it, his peers lack.
			</p>
			<p>
			It has been stated in professional discourse that Marcus Evans is in deed noted for being coined the Kanye East of the sextate region that surrounds and encompasses, OHIO. This is a deemable title as Kanye West is noted for encompassing the Chicago, IL stage as well as the New York, NY stage that currently Marcus Evans does not reside in. Marcus Evans AS Kanye East does in fact at a reasonable point in his career deserve to be working alongside Kanye West so that for a studio audience he can provide the music that Kanye West and Kanye East can craft for a global audience. It should also be noted that in the interest of industry professional growth that a team of Kanye Quality Artistic Quality artists should be found as I personally cannot believe that knowing the similarties of Kanye West with Kanye East that there can only be two of them. I would imagine that growing and productive cities have personel that bare striking similarities to Kanye West and Kanye East and it should be noted that ASAP possible to industry standards of personal space and growth care being taken and to minimize shock value that at the very least SIX other Kanye Style artists should be found and introduced to each other as with this style of Music Producer personality style an astonishing amount of productivity could be gained from at least a solid octet of Kanye style Music Producers.
			</p>
			<p>
			It would serve the music industry a great deal to bring together a team of Kanye Style Music Producers, the kind of savants that can bring the quality of inspiration to each other in a way that no one else in the industry can provide for them. Knowing that there is a Kanye West and now a Kanye East it should serve to know that there could at least be a Kanye South and a Kanye North as well as a Kanye Front and Kanye Back that should serve as the basis for an album that I would like to call the "Compass" with this album serving the over arching purpose of bringing together such marque talent as the Kanye Branded groupings of artists that deserve to brand themselves with the brand KANYE. This of course would have to come with the inclusion of the ORIGINAL KANYE Brand which I am almost certain with the promise of crafting a KANYE branded item of industry work known as the "Compass" that it would serve the purpose of quite naturally elevating all of the talent that such Kanye Branded Talent would deserve to be included in.
			</p>
			<p>
			As a side note I would dare say that the KANYE branded Music Producer operates at a level that the rest of us can just sit back and watch. For a KANYE branded music producer it should be noted that NOT Carte Blanche should be given as for KANYE branded artists the sky truly is the limit BUT they should be molded as a group and crafted into an atmosphere that allows for them to compliment each othat and for the first time in their existence as I am noting in a socio-artistic theory that I would like to see enacted, essentially in short, let us bring together the marque KANYE branded talent and allow them to bring each other up to their respective levels of professionalism that only the KANYE's could craft and note for each other as I would state that NOTING Kanye West's professional output and also noting Kanye East's professional output that these creations are the birth of a new style of producer that should be catered to and crafted as a form of human artist'e that works with the KANYE group to elevate to the highest levels that the KANYE Group Think can attain as for this quality of artist, money, cash, credit or whatever you call it is of no concern as they only seek to astonish and craft the highest quality music that can be ascertained at this human level of technological advancement. To the degree that you are prepared to be astonished would be to the degree that you would be with KANYE levels of involvement in this ongoing MUSIC INDUSTRY REHABILITIATION IN THE WAKE OF NAPSTER AND THE BIRTH OF TWITTER< FACEBOOK< YOUTUBE< SOUNDCLOUD< AND GOOGLE+<
			</p>
			<p>
			I would dare say that it is quite time for a reconstruction of the RIAA to occur at a fundamental level of professional discourse so that people like Simon Cowell, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, Christina Aquilera, etc etc etc aka the judges of American Idol, X Factor, the Voice and the such can elevate even themsevles from the positions of judging television contestants to actually beliving in themsevles enough to realize that they are for lack of a better word the heads of the now dormant RIAA and in the rebirth of the RIAA it should actually be managed and run from former stars comprising of people that I notably left out in my former list of persons not delimiting Steven Tyler from this list and Country Music as well as for the first time in Music History due to the prevalance and popularity of such shows as American Idol, X Factor, and the Voice the Music Industry should just call a spade a spade and redraft and recraft the roles of historically significant super stars and allow the super stars to take hold of the industry check books and allow former stand out super stars to craft and mold the careers of up and coming artists from a perspective not limited to molding and drafting and guiding in principles that only those that have been there and achieved a certain level of fame would understand.
			</p>
			<p>
			A style of professional discourse needs to be had that takes the superstar in mind as there are more of them now than ever before and the RIAA should re-establish itself but ONLY under the control of those that were once super-stars themselves so that the the aging stars can guide the bright new and ever growing more powerful new stars into constellation positions around each other for the purpose of, well, putting on the most astonishing show we are capable of.

			<h2>How can I charge for this writing when my student loans are being paid?</h2>
			<p>
			Someday this entire webpage might make it onto a nook or a kindle or who knows maybe an epic hallmark card to someone that you want to slow down and take it slow in life. I am not saying you should read this or even take it seriously but I am saying that some people enjoy writing. Just let those people have the space they need to enjoy something that is astonishingly simple to do and astonishly therapeutic for them and their readers at the same time. Thank you for taking the time to read my website in this little space on this bigger than life ant farm. All of the ants serve a purpose and well this ant just likes to write. Remember that as you read on and read on as the updates come in the upcoming days weeks months and years. So if you have read this far thank you explicitly from me to you and quite honestly wihtout you there would be no me. Truly. Please enjoy the rest of this document and if you found this passage in this document. Just know that I appreciate you more than these words could ever amount to. This is my version of the hallmark card that just couldn't quite fit in the space allotted. Maybe someday Hallmark will come out with a Hallmark Branded Encyclopedia, until that day comes ... well. We should place them on thumbdrives and hide them with friends. We could build our own internet on thumb drives. They actually seem like a stable form of media device that could stand the test of time. CD's and DVD's have ten year life spans. I might live much longer and in my absence I would like to leave behind a gift. I have sewn much confusion for a very prescient point OR I may live for a very long time. I have the silver lining to my life wrapped around the clouds of my memories. I come from a corporate family that honestly could care less about me or rather I should say they could care more about me. I know you look at me and wonder why I do not have skrilla or cash or anything like that. I will explain myself. I firmly believe that my soul is worth more than whatever you could trade it for at the local corporate office. I wish I was washing dishes most of the time and quite honestly as far as I can tell coming from a corporate family has its perks. It really does. Money is different to me than cash is. I have plenty of money = time. I have little cash = ??? quite honestly I do not know what cash it BUT I do know that this thumb drive that you have on you is valuable. Is this thumb drive worth more than a quarter? What about a penny? Is there more precious metal in this thumb drive than there is in a penny? Do tell? I am working on behalf of those that have questions. Maybe we can provide some answers. I am not subservise. I work for a federal agency that has yet to be revealed. I was approached on the internet during my 11 year time pecking at the keys and they informed me that I would be very useful for the government as an overt liason between them and those. I was watching and working and working on behalf of the federal government. They would be providing me with my phone shortly. I cannot tell you much more than the fact that I ACTUALLY do have above top secret clearance and have been vetting people to disseminate a message. Your local politician will know nothing about this at all. Your local police department will know even less. I can be incarcerated or locked up but only if I break certain laws. I was told to observe and take the role of a historian as my time on the internet proved very valuable. I was instructed to obtain peak performance in my body and to stop smoking cigarettes. At the point I become modelesque in stature I would begin at that time to receive future orders. I could tell you that I work for a secret organization OR I could just flat out tell you that I do in fact work on behalf of the Illuminati. You may be involved and not even know it. I am crafting liasonic documents for a thumb drive. You may believe that the internet is the end all be all communications structures OR you can participate in this global culture that I am aware of and building a node for at this moment. I am node building. What this is exactly, is working from a computer that is LOCAL only and accumulating thumb drives. From these thumb drives I am asking that you observe this knowledge that is being disseminated and upload your own thoughts to these pieces of technology. Yes this is a secret organization that your involvement is to your own discretion or need or want to be involved. I could be the guy that has a government phone or I could be the person that shared this knowledge with you. I wrote this but you do not know if I actually wrote it. I may be working in conjunction with multiple dimensions that are all at various stages of destruction from a multi dimensional war that is taking place from this point in existence here. I believe that we are being informed that our dimension is the least destructed and that we have the greatest chance to build a hyper node that takes the form of a hyper dimensional airport for lack of a better term that allows for beings and people from other places to pass through this dimension and build an understanding of how we survived the thought plague so easily. Rhymeskills are rare in other dimensions. There is little care for Rap in other dimensions and in this dimension original thought is required. There is a way you can play chess with four people. The first step is to place all of the pieces to the side and grab four chess boards. You want four chess boards for this to work. You literally want 32 x 32 for this game to work. What you do is draft your eight pieces and then wait. You then roll the dice and through sheer chance you determine with your own rules and dice who goes first second third and fourth at placing their pieces on the board. What this entails in that you could place all of your pieces or only one. On any given moment you may allow yourself to either make a move or place a piece. You lose when all of your pieces are gone or when the king is killed. Typically you can make a bold move and draft the king first or just see who drafts the king. Then depending on how you feel about the person that drafted the king you may then work to defend the king or attack the king. Either way the game ends when the king dies. Someone might draft eight pawns or someone might draft rooks and bishops or someone may draft the queen or the king. What this game is to be is entirely organic. You want to conversate in this advanced form of chess and learn more about your opponents and allys than just to sincerely wage war. You can place a peaceful game of chess and the rook can cross from one side of the board to the next. The bishops can cross boundaries as well. The pawns advance at the borders and may advance in either a up down left or right movement. If a pawn reaches the left side of the board it may advance ONLY if another piece has been taken. A pawn may only advance if a rook or a knight or a bishop or a queen has been taken. IF on the very next move after the king is defeated a PAWN advances to an upgradeable state the pawn may take the king's role BUT ONLY if it on the very next move. If there is no pawns one position away from an advancement rank then the king does not reincarnate. The king CAN reincarnate into another person's quest and the game can continue. The man that lost the king does in fact lose a piece and must play on with seven pieces. If played properly the king can be the last piece on the board with all other pieces being taken and can in fact win the game BUT that is the most difficult element of the game. Strategy is and friendship and to an extent animosity come into play for this game. There are two kings on the board. One will win but your team can consist of black or white pieces if you would wish. If your pieces are of ALL WHITE then you have to decide if you should defend or attack the king to your own pleasure. If your pieces are ALL BLACK then you can decide to work with or against your king. You may defeat your king at any point if you wish and have a position to do so. The interesting element of this is that during the draft someone may draft the black and white queen at the same time. Someone may also play the king and the king as well and play may continue. You must step back from traditional chess in this game because this is more quantum than algebraic chess. What you want to do is play a good game. Walk away with in depth knowledge of your players and continue living. There is an element of GO to this game and at the end of the game it would be interesting to discuss what you were thinking as you played this game of chess with your comrades. Bobby Fischer has never played this game of chess before. I can assure you of that BUT this would be a game that Bobby Fischer would need to play to think outside the box again. The point is not to master this game but to experience it holistically over drinks and smokes. You yourself cannot be given a master set of rules for this game as it is astonishingly incomplete. We as a chess playing community must finish this game as the rules are rudimentary at first but quite honestly surprise your opponents. At some point you may wish to draft a new move unexpectedly for a piece to the extent that you simply take out another player OTHER than the king UNLESS it will reincarnate in the next move. If you are planning on chess king reincarnation then so be it that is within the rules. There is also an element of surprise as pawns are to be treated as youth. You do not want your youth harassing adults such as bishops, rooks, knights, and queens. You want your adults to do their work and let the pawns watch to an extent and attain adult hood. Chess can be like the game of life when expanded to four boards. It is a more expensive game than one board chess BUT you are playing with four liaisons as opposed to just two. Use your imagination and let this be a game of allowing yourself to expand what you think a game can be. I am leaving this document open in the hopes that that someone will expand this treatise and bring me back upgrades and improvements and rules. I ask you the audience of this writing to build this game and possibly even bring in a set of four dice to the game that you can then use to determine how the game should progress. Typically games are locked and boxed and given to you with all of the rules spelled out for you. There is in fact an element of Dungeons and Dragons to this in that you are to go from this sub set of rules and craft your very own way of playing the game. If you find that you have an astonishing group of play between you and three of your friends. Find more people to play with and bring boards together and expand the game. If you end up with 32 boards in play create poles that move the piece for you as the center of the game board would be difficult to reach.

			<h2>Is Lucius Pixel ... Touched?</h2>
			<p>
			The other day I was walking down the street trying to understand how it all went. I had been treated like a psyco path for the better part of a decade when in my heart of hearts I knew something was off. I did not try and act like my family hated me until I knew they in fact did. I am what is known as an innocent. Fully blameless in all but the bedroom. You may have quibbles over what I do with another person with my clothing off but quite honestly you know nothing about my bedroom behavior unless you experience it yourself. All of this quantifying of flesh bothers me to know end. I have no problem spending time with anyone until it comes down to sexual politics. Then I am bothered. We all know there are haters. We know this very well but to get into a zone where you try and outlaw opinion over your behavior is an abomination on any level. I have kissed men before and been kissed by men before. I navigate sexuality as I and my partners see fit. Yes I am still a virgin because I have no children. The way I see it you are factually a virgin until you have children. I do feel a certain way about the color of a wedding dress. If you are getting married with children have the decency to wear an elegant shade of gray. Why do all women love to wear white at their wedding. Why do we allow ourselves to fool ourselves into thinking we are what we want ourselves to be. I live in a world where my wife may very well wear stone cold black at my wedding because of the way she feels about me. My wife might mourn being with me the entirety of her life because she may in fact love someone else BUT because I can provide a lifestyle she may politically be with me. I am looking for something organic and natural. I want to be with someone that actually laughs at my jokes. That actually is attracted to me and is not through some kind of city scape mind game plague me with her presence. I have dated multiple women before at multiple times. I became celibate after my 25th year of existence when I bedded a bartendress and found my life going into free fall since then. I may priest this existence out rather than fall victim to the Mike Jones effect. I have been through much but women, well women, they have standards and they have facebook and what I am seeing before me sickens me. I downloaded a woman the other day. We spent 18 hours together before we slept together. She wanted to go rounds with me but when I tried to bring out the natural relationship vibe she dipped like a mofo. I have nothing else to say about her. To an extent I understand that my love life is causing my professional life problems. I never went on tour BUT I know how to treat a woman better than Machine Gun Kelly. These new guys. These digital rock stars. They are not refined as the old school. Come up a little too quickly. Think they know it all and have the game mastered when they have never even been in love. Mac Miller talking about hoes and bitches and getting his nuts kissed when that is fine but mother fucker to put that out on the public radar. WTF? Then you have Macklemore who gave us this whole some image of who he is and what he is and then he was in a porno video the other day. Then you have Machine Gun Kelly. He does it right. He really does. Cleveland gets into women and has the best chance at being famous for eternity. Say what you want about Mac or Mac le More but quite honestly the rock star game is and always has been about treating women and being an object of attraction. Mac Miller from Pittsburgh may want his nuts kissed and he stunts with the thing in the video because maybe that is the one he likes. Pittsburgh is a different kind of city than Cincinnati is. We call ourselves the Queen City for a reason mainly because we do not put up with a lot of bullshit. I was a star once but because of my dalliances with women I lost a lot of luster. We hold ourselves up to an astonishingly high level of acumen here in Cincinnati. We are what you call civilized. We always run a deficit which is because we know our position as a mofo city in American and international life. We had plans to build a subway system but the wars got started. We are just getting our breath beneath us and working to instill our future futures with a subway system that will sustain continual growth as a city state. We have a future in Cincinnati. One day we may even go so far as to clean the OHIO river from at least this point. Hell even our homeless sometimes get votes running for mayor. We are just a different kind of city. Cleveland impresses me. They have aroung 100,000 people and they know how to treat a lead singer. They really do. They also have the mofo rock and roll hall of fame in Cleveland. Little known fact. I know a thing or two about stardom since I have seen about 10,000 music videos. I understand the mind state of a star and the kind of math you have to run to function as a star. I might be the incarnation of your sun walking amongst you shining like the daisies in spring trying to understand what exactly I am shedding light on. I wish I could say I love you but I have love for so very few because I am at a point in my life where to be loved by me means you have to spend time with me. I love very few. I hate even fewer. Most of you do not even exist to me because I never see you. You never come to my parties. I have led the most awkward existence you could possibly imagine and just now as I am peaking in power is the world changing around me. I see the stars shining at night and through the oceans I depict stations in life. There was a time when we used to use stars to navigate through life. I am the mourning star because the Mike Jones Syndrome will happen to me and I will just go with it. Trust me it will be as awkward for you as it is for me but from this knowledge WE will grow. I have no god. I have a goddess. I worship the goddess like the brightest equation on a white board. I cherish the women that I spend time with and wonder what it was all supposed to mean. I remember when dating was all about finding a nice girl to make laugh. I lived in the suburbs then. Now I live in the city. OH THE CITY IS DIFFERENT! It really is. There is interrelationships and quantifiable qualities that women put you through. They know who they want to talk to and why. There is a thing called Status in the city. I can attest to that. Your sexual experience is tied in deeply to your civic standing. If you rank high enough you can have a harem if you attain that. If you play your cards right and evoke the right public opinion of yourself and work hard enough you can have a girlfriend too. Its crazy. Money. The promise of money. The use of money. I have money. I have 24 hours a day. Seven days a week. Four weeks a month. Twelve months a year when it comes to money. Time. Money. Time. Money. I am not good enough because I do not have the time put into my city yet. I am a new guy people are just getting to know. Is it cool to like him? How deeply should I REALLY hate him? What could it mean to my friends if I talked to him? He used to be fat and kind of still is. I know. I get it. I walk around this city that I am never going to leave and I just watch the show. I know women have a system in the city for ranking men. I have never been high enough to have a girlfriend even though I have had girlfriends. I could name a couple of them if you want. Its never really about conversation anymore. I remember the BUZZ and what the BUZZ did for me. I remember meeting random people like ADAM and getting my cards read. They told me that one day the city of Cincinnati would become the spiritual capital of the world. I just went with it. I come through so much and torment is how I have been feeling lately. I can hear you , you know? I hear voices that are cogent and of course its just my imagination from having spent too many hours crafting conversations on the pages. My mind is wide open in a sort of John Malcovich sense. I spend time with you even when you are not spending time with me. My aura casts a seriousness that you may or may not understand. I know I am an adult now. I know that I am all open and all man. I am from the S culture you strangely do not want to talk about. Just solid S culture. I roam around this one street I live on and I am not even desperately trying to earn a living. I just do.

			<h2>The Internet</h2>
			<p>
			There was a great awakening as the computer showed us who we were. It was like we were living on a broken spaceship. We called our life the game. It was a symphonic display of anarchy wherever we turned. Just about the time that you discovered a new secret to the game you found roughly thirty five ways that that secret was being used against you. What you really learned was that the government was not corrupt , no , they were just further along in their power studies than you and your friends were. This entire planet was dedicated to power and the attainment of power. A saving grace was that Greece recently decided to embrace mulit-theism. This should help because monotheism can only get you so far and is only truly relevant in a world dominated by mass media where the star of the moment is entrusted with sharing the cogent message. When and what it comes down to is that monotheism is what we are all rebelling against. We are all in the middle class rebelling against this idea that the supreme leader is a conduit to God when in reality we are just people. Some people can do this and some people can do that. It just comes down to the fact that the when people decide to be confident amazing things can happen. I honestly really do not believe that I should be here. I fantasize about a reality where I was destroyed repeatedly by the government but by some saving grace I was decided by the Q or some other salient force to be a force of positive action. I was confident in my abilities but at the same time curious as to why so many other people lacked insight into their own condition. I was treading water with my head only slightly above the level of the water. I could drown at any moment. I was steadfastly dedicated to the notion that one day my city would expand it's borders out roughly 500 miles in every direction. Where were the roman numerals I was accustomed to observing. What exactly was this Arabic numeric system and why was it so popular. I had no idea. As I sat down at my work station it occurred to me what I had been missing for so long. I was trying to understand exactly what my vacation was about and why exactly I was not working. I tried desperately to find a way out of my horrendous situation that led to multiple needle injections of a very disruptive medication that impeded my ability to think. I was still recovering from Zyprexia which was a medication that was given to me I imagine for the sole purposes of making me unfit to procreate. I had no idea how powerful my family was. I only knew that I did not want to be a part of them any more. I had a government phone coming soon BUT I was concerned it would be tapped and discussed among higher ups. I was constantly concerned about being followed or discussed by the government t for being a successful college graduate. I knew roughly how advanced certain aspects of the population were and I also knew roughly how far behind other subsets of the population were as well. I found myself in the intelligentsia of the middle class wondering about things like magic and phrenology. At one time this population several million man years prior truly believed in phrenology like it was science. I looked at the American psychiatric asscociation as though they were a gift and a curse. I truly believed that one day the APA would be a force for good but what if one day they were so powerful they continued their deviant social experiments. How deeply was personal ego hated and why did you have to earn a powerful ego by going through a decades long obstacle course. I had no idea. My psychiatric doctor was the type of person that I did not have much consideration for. I was just given a reprieve on my next meeting with her. As far as she knew I could not trust her much further than I could throw her. I just imagined that for a brief second there was no hope for humanity and then I thought of my friends and realized that because we were still working, there was at least hope for us which on some level would be hope for humanity, at least our families. I had given up with trying to save the world and truly started to think locally and act globally. I wrote the Israeli newspaper once and asked if Israel even knew what the 10 Commandments were. It seemed like a prescient conversation starter. I just see Israel as this place that honestly believes that the word NOT truly means to continue doing so. I wonder sometimes if a breakdown in language constructs could truly be the most powerful weapon that could be onslaught. That the cohesion of a clear thought coming through the media was being washed away in favor of blatant randomness for the sole purpose of pushing original thought away. I had a feeling that the government had no interest in public education or even a cogent ability to read. That was up to you. It was crazy how at times the universe seemed to talk to me. I believed that the world was changing faster than I could imagine. I stayed away from the media and as I am writing this I am working on a local drive that is not attached to the mainframe computer. I believe truly that a solid sneaker net would be useful at this time period. I believe that as far as sneaker nets go for attaining local and national fame that that would be the way to go. As they are trying to lock down and impregnate the internet with astonishing acts of cruelty to craft a business where websites are built for CD dissemination it would be amazing or even thumb drives so that a mainstream could be constructed for and by the people that cared about such things. I was curious as to whether I just knew a little too much about my fellow man where in the past I would have just been a public spectacle. It was amazing to me how few people cared about such basic human needs as creativity or even love. I had a mind to believe that even I was not capable of love even thought I firmly believed that love was the careful crafting of social chemistry between yourself and the people around you. Love was not an abstract concept to me. It was a feeling you left someone with that allowed them to know you appreciated your time with them and hoped they appreciated their time with you even though you never really knew. Jay-Z talked about blood suckers and leeches and to an extent I feel that I may have encountered such people around the way from time to time. I was starting to notice what real friendship was. Real friendship was clear of any strange word choice or magic that made you feel abused or taken advantage of. How was I supposed to know that after 33 years of life that I was sorely in need of quality friendship. Common values and aspirations for life were the kinds of things that I knew you could build a life long friendship with. I was interested in finding a lovely woman to spend time with because quite honestly I could use some female interaction at this point. There is a style of conversation that you can have with a woman that you honestly cannot have with a man. I just know that. I believe in the eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and quite honestly it is amazing to me to understand that the world we live in could read a little more. Could fathom a little deeper and could truly ask more profound questions. I was living in a moment trying to understand the world around me and quite honestly I had no idea what to say. Do you like to read? If you do not I might not be very interesting to you. I write books and have deleted and hidden much of my work. You will never find my work on the internet even though I know where it is. I could tell you where my work hides but then you might not believe me that I actually wrote as much as I did. My vacation was over. I was actively trying to craft a new style of writing. My plan was to craft one hundred pages of writing and then craft that .txt file. I wanted to take that file and slowly accumulate thumdrives. I would then purposefully craft my own internet ala sneakernet factually. A thumbdrive can hold roughly 1gb of date on the low end and that is plenty of space for me to accomplish my task. I read about a game that was created that lived and breathed on a thumb drive and you could only play it once and there was only one thumb drive in existence. Some things do have an honor code associated with them. I was working with a man that was starting the GCDC or as it was known in its elongated form the Greater Cincinnati Def Club. I liked the idea and was crafting a piece of work for it. I believe that the world could use an internet 0.5 as opposed to an internet 2.0. I imagine that we have too much too quickly and are not capable of piecing together pieces of the puzzle quickly enough. My current plan is to acquire thumb drives as I had stated earlier and drop files on those drives. I would at this point try and lock the files on the drive OR not and would after accumulating roughly 500 thumb drives approach people and ask that they pay me roughly $25 per thumb drive or therein a price point similar. I would use this money to then start a fund where I would buy MORE thumbdrives and from a local drive computer download content to a thumbdrive net that would allow for people to interact with and add volume and quality to open files that could be elongated and added to. I wanted to create something that could grow from an inception point. This being that point .

			<h2>The City</h2>
			<p>
			Oh the city. The city that houses itself in buildings built by generations that were killed in the war. I remember the way time used to go. I remember time used to fly by. Now it rests on the landing strip like a manufactured organism of logic. 
			</p>
			<p>
			This is about writing is it not. I remember writing. I remember trying to entertain people on the open mic. I started my life as a celebrity at Codys Cafe and have always been victim to having been loved and then kicked the fuck out of the bar. I have always been weird. I know this. I have always been special. I know this. I have always taken the time to craft care for the people around me. I speak in syllables that do not arouse anger and yet I strangely do. The mourning star. What am I mourning for? Am I mourning for the fact that I know I am rising like the star of the morning. Is it the morning star or the mourning star? Maybe it is easier for the moon to love us because nothing terrible happens under the moon but the Sun, well the sun gets to see us doing business. Or shall we say ... BUSY NESS. Oh yes the great march towards profits in a world where we can do anything we want and this is what we do. We could be doing just fine with monopolies crafting balanced equations for interacting with society but capital competition is the name of the game. Honestly. Coca Cola ... Pepsi ... RC ... yes we do in fact need three separate companies making sugar water. We should dedicate a percentage of our work force to people crafting sugar water. Yes this is good and wholesome. We are not in need of an economic overhaul because everyone is doing what they want. Yes. This is good. We truly need Apple, Microsoft, Google, and IBM. This way they can thwart each other and reap the benefits of ill prepared property. It is interesting how the national media to this day does not act like the internet exists. An entire ecosystem of culture exists but hey traffic might go up if they mention something that is not on the cultural radar. Truly FACEBOOK and GOOGLE are the only websites which were built by NON college graduates but really what do you learn in that last year anyways? What does college really teach us? Not much. Its mostly blather right? I know I am educated. I spent $120,000 on what I was trying to say. I know I am important whether you admit it or not. I know what my online statistics are. I know I am important. VIP. Yeah that is what I worked for. I crafted a career out of knowing where this game is going and knowing how to navigate the game. Life. Its interesting what all of this is. I could be something that shows you the poetic side of life with a design sensibility. Design. The act of refining an idea down to its most basic components touched up with elegance and finance. Its astonishing what can happen with a little design. It really is. I believe in the world at large. I believe in the future of our future. I believe that the torch needs to be passed to the 1980 +Forward generation as we are diametrically different that our parents that built this lovely contraption that they never taught us how to use. They did not even teach us how to use it in design school, they just left us to ourselves on a brand new global infrastructure. The way I see it. We need a single website, oh we do. It is called the glowing screen. The lyrical insurrection. I was not a part of that though an understudy of Hakiym Sha'ir. Its all beautiful if you think about it. I love it to life. I imagine death is like this. You find yourself looking down at your body. You look around. You find the nearest hospital if you want to stay in the area. You lay down in a pregnant woman and you come into this world as a newborn OR you could visit an abortion clinic and lay into a woman about to have an abortion and then well then you disappear into the sheer random lottery of life to reappear somewhere as yet undiscovered. I am going to die in this city and then I am going to come back again right here. Shortly after I die. I am going to keep doing this until I get my point across that this world is less strange than you think and more strange than you could possibly imagine. Do you enjoy playing halo? Do you enjoy your video games? Really? How old are you? Are you older than 16? Oh really you play video games like it's a part time job? Oh really AND you want to be treated like you are cool? Awesome. Yes keep pushing finance into video games so that more people can forget how to ride bikes and cook food. We could use a couple less intelligents and a couple more mental invalids. I do tell. Its astonishing how the world goes. OH I know you learn quite a lot from halo ... Paintball anyone? Oh yeah moving is so difficult? And conversations? Yeah those keep getting better. I would love love love to hear about how you are still trying to save the princess Zelda. Yes. Do tell. Quite honestly I work without an editor. I value intelligence in myself and those around me. I dare say at this point you might not be able to understand what I am talking about but like so many other things that is not my fault. I am and have been pursuing academic excellence and quite honestly if you copied off of me in high school then at this point we might not have much to talk about.

			<h2>A Light Hearted Play</h2>
			<p>
			There was a spider sitting on the bench. A man sat down next to the spider. The spider looked at the man. The man looked at the spider. The man was not afraid of the spider. The spider noticed that the man was not afraid of the spider so the spider calmed down. The man took a sheet of paper and placed it underneath the spider and the spider was comfortable. The man lifted the spider up and let it rest on his shoulder. It was a female spider. The female spider was comfortable. The man got up and walked into an ice cream store and brought the spider with him. The man and the spider were both unnoticed by the people in the ice cream restaurant but the man knew something that the other people did not. The spider trusted him. So the man trusted the spider. The man and the spider sat in the ice cream store and began to have a conversation. This is that conversation. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: Do you know how many times and how often men like you crush me?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Quite often. I know.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: To what benefit is there to destroying a blatantly innocent spider?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: None.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: There are dangerous insects in the insect kingdom and we oversee their lack of reproduction.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I did not know that but it makes sense.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: What do you do?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I do something similar.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: In what way?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I am a website designer. I create networks of information with the sole intent being to karmically trap the people that cause society a problem in networks of sound that they did not know existed.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: I do the same. Is this work easy for you?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Quite.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: Who are you usually trying to entrap?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Men who call women and think that women are bitches currently.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: What happens when a man is caught in your trap.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: He typically gets married and has a couple of children.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: You allow your captures to procreate? We end the existence of ours.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I do the same.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: But their DNA passes on.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Yes but they lose the ability to think for themselves and ultimately become harmless entities with powerless blood.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: Do you see that woman over there?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Yes.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: I want you to introduce yourself to her.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I wish not to.
			</p>
			<p>
			Spider: I wish it so. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The man gets up and walks over to the woman. She is wearing a skimpy bikini that shows off the curves of her body. There is a beach outside and this happens all of the time. The man with now a spider in his pocket walks over to the woman and compliments her on her smile. She is truly a Brazilian beauty. She knows what he knows that she knows what he knows. So they began a conversation. The man looked in his pocket to see where the spider was. There was no spider. There never was. Not in this reality. In this reality this is the reality where this was no spider the man was in a reality where he had a spider but then as he began to walk into the atmosphere of this woman, the spider disappeared. As spiders often do.
			</p>
			<p>
			Sometimes a man sees something that makes him think of something that makes him does something and then when he goes to thank the thing that brought him to the point where he was at the moment where he wanted to thank something, that something is gone.
			</p>
			<p>
			So the man knows now that he has transferred to the reality where there is no spider. The woman would have been scared of the spider most likely. So the man starts to talk to the woman with no spider in his pocket. This is how the conversation between a man from Cincinnati and the woman from Brazil went as she was wearing the skimpiest bikini that anyone could possibly imagine. She was not naked but she was close.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I like men that like my smile.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Do you come here often?
			</p>
			<p>
			As the opening lines of this discourse are what is known as openers between men and women. The man was dressed in the finest Italian suit which makes him naked to a woman. The woman was dressed in three pieces of string which makes her naked to a man.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Do you like my bikini?
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Quite.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Seriously though, I do not talk to men often when I am wearing this but maybe you know how it feels to wear one. Would you take off your jacket so that I can be more comfortable?
			</p>
			<p>
			The man then took off his jacket with slow motion smooth moves. He then reached around and handed it to the woman who put it on. It was the middle of winter here in Cincinnati and she was quite cold.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Thank you for your jacket. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I live right up the street would you like to have some coffee.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I would love to have some coffee.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I have never seen you before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: You may have just not noticed before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I can understand why you may think that but I have never seen your face before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I have seen yours. I have passed you walking my dog while you were walking your dog. You have even said hello to me before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I wish that I could say I remember but I really quite do not.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Maybe you could take off your tie.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Are you trying to strip me naked?
			</p>
			<p>	
			Woman: No I am just trying to get to know you.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man then took off his tie and went about handing his french silk tie to the brazilian woman was previously quite public and quite nude. She accepted his tie and in a quite robust fashion went about crafting a tie around her neck. She was now in the man's noose.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: You were cold and I gave you my jacket. You were unadorned and I gave you my tie.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: That is not quite true. You did not give me anything for all that exists on this planet exists because I wish it to exist.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: How so?
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: You gave me back my overcoat and you gave me back my tie. Please do not misunderstand me but you and all of your friends and relatives work for me and always have.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I would like to believe I work for myself.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Well you do not.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Who do you work for.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I have no need to work. No want to work. No desire to work. I have been traveling by your side for the last several aeons and now here we find ourselves in a Graeter's Ice Cream Parlor for no reason other than the fact that you have gone too far.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I do not quite know what going too far means.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I will tell you what going too far means. Going too far means not listening to your mate for eternal life when she tells you NOT to build an oil rig in the middle of the ocean. Some things should just not be done for no reason other than they should just not be done.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: All things should be done.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Maybe we differ on what we think a thing is.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: A thing is something that needs to know it exists.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: All things are not good things.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: My thing that I craft into reality is good.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I would like to see your apartment.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: I would like to show you my apartment.
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: Then let us go.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man and the woman that was now dressed in a moment that she previously was not is now sitting here trying to look into this man as she has looked into all of the others. He was brave enough to offer me back my clothing. So the man and the woman now went down the street she now more clothed than she was before and he now less clothed than he was before. 
			</p>
			<p>
			They walked down the sidewalk and came upon an apartment complex. The man opened the door and let her in. He was neither happy nor sad just anticipating what could happen next. So the man and the woman went up two flights of stairs and they came to a door.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man reached into the breast pocket of the now woman's jacket and took out a set of keys. She was now beginning to become nervous.
			</p>
			<p>
			So the man took the keys and elegantly as he has done many times before placed his key into the lock and opened the door. He walked in first to make sure it was safe just in case and then he invited her in.
			</p>
			<p>
			She came into the apartment that was exquisitely masculine in its state of d�cor and she closed the door behind her and locked it and locked the door.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man then living in a one room apartment showed her his computer and asked if she would like to see what he does with it. The conversation started like this.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Yeah that is it. That is that Apple Computer I tried so hard to get. I spent decades working year after year to afford this lovely highly technical piece of work that my people created and it has everything I ever wanted. A wifi connection. A USB Drive. It glows and plays music and movies. It causes me no problems. I can get into trouble for using it improperly. Yeah there it is. I own an Apple Computer. Love it. I love my Apple Computer I really do. I love it so much. Can you see my computer? Do you know it exists? Like if I asked you to touch my computer what would you do?
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: I would reach out and touch that computer that you asked me to.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Can you see it? Does it exist? Can you use it? Does it do anything you wish it did not? What does the computer say to you?
			</p>
			<p>
			Woman: That a man can do anything a man wants to do.
			</p>
			<p>
			Man: Damn right bitch.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man then proceeded to take his jacket off that was crafted by an Italian suit designer in Milan. The man then left his tie on the woman. He then asked her to stand roughly three paces east and stand at the foot of the bed. She did so and then what happened was luxurious. He pushed her onto the bed and proceeded to do what she said he would do. Anything he wants.
			</p>
			<p>
			So he was feeling passionate because around a woman from Brazil it is hard not to feel passion. So he went into exotic fits of passion crafting and went about reminding woman that all they really want is a man to take control which is what the fuck this man did.
			</p>
			<p>
			The man laid on the bed and the woman straddled on top of him. She went about taking off his shirt and she noticed that he did not have the six pack that she had hoped he would have. This is the man's fault. She was hoping for a physique that would turn her on. No matter he was still in control so he was still attractive to her.
			</p>
			<p>
			She moved her entire body down his and came down to his pants. She crafted a moment where she went and pulled down his zipper extravagantly slowly. The man was lit with anticipation. She crafted a moment where she undid his pants and then she rubbed her cheek against it to let the man know what was going to happen next.
			</p>
			<p>
			She used her right

			<h2>A Love Letter To No One In Particular ...</h2>
			<p>
			I could be the rain that brings a desert some roses. The sands of time pass one moment through the hourglass. I believe in miracles that could never amount to anything more than an astonishing amount of transcendence. I believe in miracles yet unseen. One of these days I am going to meet a beautiful woman and we are going to fall in love. I transcend the miracles of life that surround me nightly. Every now and again I think about the time I saw a cicada fall from a tree and die. I surround myself with better people than I am. I have friends that do not have the time to talk to me. I make my own resources in a world that is destined for divinity. I see the ants in the ant farm milling about and I wonder where their queen is. It has been a long time since I have been in love. I still think about my first kiss. I spent too much time trying to decipher reality and then I fell in love with people that do not know who I am. I come from a queen city that knows so little about me. I am fine with being tortured mentally for ten years because it only made me stronger. I could try and recite some poetry but no one loves poetry like I do. I believe in reincarnation and maybe we will see each other again. One of these days I am finally going to lose the rest of the weight I gained on some pills that were supposed to make me better. Nothing means everything next to someone that is holding your hand. I believe in beauty in a way that makes me feel that everyone is. I have found enough silver linings around the clouds of my life that I could build a cube with ten foot sides. Sometimes I think to myself that writing is the only thing I was ever meant to do. I am less humble than I am proud. I am proud of who I am because I think that the universe was made with people like me in mind. One of these days I am going to enter the gates of heaven and then I am going to turn around and come right back here to purgatory and spend time with people deciding if they want to go to heaven or hell. I have been a dancer all of my life. One of these days I am finally going to meet someone that is going to want to go on a date. I could be the man that changes your life for the better or helps you get through that difficult spate in your life. Every now and then I try and perform at a show just so that people know that poets do poetic things. I believe in nature and that I am somehow connected to the pygmy goats that I see walking around my reality. Women love small gestures of kindness more than they like twelve page letters. I know this because I have tried. One of you women might like me and the rest might like someone else. I am fine with being single I get to spend time with myself that way. I see small people doing big things. I try and fathom eternity from a moment in time. Sometimes I walk for long distances just to see where I end up and I get lost trying to find myself. I write so much that there is no hope for me to ever make sense again unless I am sitting here with an alphabet trying to make sense of the world. I wish I could make the world make sense but that might not happen for a long time. The rain falls mostly on the plains of Spain because the Spaniards deserve the water they receive. From time to time I look at woman and wonder what they are looking for. I never really know if they see a man in me but I am new to being an adult man anyways. I believe that the world is changing faster than people can keep up with. I see smart phones being used by confused people. I see change occurring in so many places that I just have to wonder where this is all going. Do you ever think about how old some people are? Do you ever wonder where they were before they are where they are right now? One time I discovered the difference between this moment and this moment and I wondered what the distance between two moments was. Was it four inches or four light years? Could there be a mathematical equation developed that would help us locate ourselves when we lose ourselves in society? Every now and again I wish on a star and then I throw a penny on the sidewalk. Because I was trained in the world of ways of worlds that have never been I sometimes try and imagine if John Lennon was killed because he wrote the song Imagine. Did he imagine a world where he would die because of a gun shot. Did Yoko Ono miss him or did she just keep trying to become more famous than the beatles? How many slices of bread are in a typical loaf? Why did David Thoreau spend so much time observing a pond. Is it possible to reach a point in life where you just want to help people live their lives better until they know why you are doing what you are doing? Did you sleep well last night because I had a dream that you were sleeping in a dream waiting to wake up. Maybe the world stops spinning if you think about it enough. What would happen if everyone on earth either stared at the moon or the sun at the same time? Why is the moon the same size as the sun in the sky? Which came first the answer or the question? How often do we really take the time to meet someone new? Could cars be time machines since they save so much of it? Would our towns be more interesting if everyone did not drive downtown to work in a job they did not want to do? What happens when the writers start being honest? Do you ever think about the fact that without designers we would have no letters to type with? Do you ever think about if we had no writers we would have no sentences to talk with? Does it ever occur to you that college students work harder than retail store clerks? Do you ever think about the fact that the future is something we build and that it just does not just happen? The past is what is but the future is everything that is not but could be. How many times do you have to get your heart broken before you stop trying to mend it and put the pieces back together? When the world is changing do you ever notice? How often do the winds of change have to blow before you fall asleep and let it happen? If you could be anyone you wanted to be , would it be you? I could be a minister or I could be a gangster or I could be a priest or I could be a secretary or I could be myself. The most astonishing moment in a man's life is when he realizes he is conscious. The second most astonishing moment is when he realizes that his eyeballs are attached to his brain. The third most astonishing moment in a man's life is when he realizes his art will live on longer than he will. I could be the man that changes your life and you could be the woman that changes mine. This is a love letter to no one in particular. I believe in head strong people and supple hearts. One of these days I am finally going to mail that letter to that person that could use cheering up. If you build it they will come only if you really want them to. I was writing to find a passage that would make sense to you. I was guessing that the world was actually the most beautiful color blue. She was never really trying to get my attention and lately I was not actually trying to get hers. There are a couple of ways we could do this but a love letter to no one in particular might be the most romantic. I was trying to become romantic again for no reason at all. I guess the world was trying to entertain a moment in time while I was trying to unwind my lessons on life. She was just hoping the world was going to behave but really that was not how it works. Sometimes the reasons we do things are more profound than the things we do, well most of the time actually. How often do the parties we throw turn out better than expected. I guess the world is trying to imagine a better day while I am just trying to imagine a new way to do the same thing all over again. For the first time I am trying to imagine a way to write this story the way I need to write this story. They said writing needed a problem to be the kind of writing people would want but I think this style of writing would do just fine. I wish I knew a formula that would be the writing style I could write forever but this will do for now. Do you ever just want to read writing so that you do not have to follow a plot, this will help you with that. Sometimes when you are trying to fathom the terror of your past you forget that it was just a memory and in that memory you can smoke some weed and forget it more easily than you thought you could the first time but honestly why would you want to forget it even though you want to and you are trying to and then you succeed but then it comes back and then you hit this weed and it all explodes into a pear that you are eating and trying to remember the reasons why you ever cared about anything because hey you have this apartment and a dog and a friend and a computer and are just working to build on something from this and honestly when it comes to writing its not what you write that counts it's the fact that you do. So the moonshine was changing all through the atmosphere and one day the earth is going to write a love letter to the moon and the sun is going to get jealous and explode but the moon will write a love letter for the sun as the sun writes a love letter for earth as earth writes a love letter to the moon and then some kids will write love letters to the stars and the stars will write love letters to the black holes and the big bang will write a love letter to the end of time and somehow these love letters will change the way we view writing love letters because lately I have been wanting to write a love letter to no one in particular just because these days writing love letters makes more sense when twitter could be filled with the love that would love us loving love so here goes to love the love that we love to love as we love love for the sake of love as love is what love is supposed to be while we love love until love finally starts to love love again. I could be the challenger explosion recast as a dangerous liason with esoteric meaning that you forgot to have and I am duct taping my life together because I do not want a new life so in this life I am writing for all of the reasons that I could be writing and as I am writing I am changing the ways that I write so that I can write some more in this world that is more beautiful than a couple of starlets flying through the sky above the ocean near a beach in new jersey. I have seen the red tailed hawk and I have taken photographs of the gecko and I have seen the goats and I have taken my time to read the words of the people that wrote before me. I write with an intent to write for the reasons you could not remember but here I am writing for the reasons you could write with as I write for no reason to write for writing is the writing of the seasons of change and I might take the time to let you read this as I take it to kinkos one page at a time to read the reasons that you could change the seasons of time and my writing is special as it is supposed to be and one day I will write this and see what happens as kinkos may publish this or some other publishing arm and who knows how all of this is supposed to work out as I might take this into a language of writing you never knew existed and latex this writing with latex just to set it in points of light that could change the worlds that change the times of exchanges for no reason other than to change the words of worlds that could never be more to me than I could be for you as we are what we want to be as we are all that we are supposed to be in a world that is asking us to be more than we are in a moment than we are capable of being so we keep on becoming that which we are supposed to be to the people that are not what we think we want to be for children that want to be like us as we just want them to live in a world less confusing than we did because our lives were more confusing than difficult and maybe confusing is worse than difficult but who knows because none of this makes any sense but these kids seem to know what to do so hey, maybe we could do something nice for some kids and show them that yeah this world is going to make a lot more sense to you than it did for us and maybe you will find our flaws that we never knew we had and you won't make our mistakes and maybe your kids will find your flaws and one day someone is going to think this thing is flawless but until they do just keep wearing diamonds to keep the world worth a wedding ceremony that we are always awaiting to have happen. I was interested in nirvana not that kind of nirvana yeah that kind of nirvana the kind that comes with flowers floating down from the sky as I could be the one that takes the reins let me see this again as I was changing like the emotions that I was supposed to be leaving behind because maybe something was supposed to happen to me but it really did not and if you don't ask I wont tell and we can write the spells that the world works with for the times that the world is changing and I could be the messenger that lets you know its all good as I just gave a show to some young adults and maybe they don't know who I am but that does not mean I don't and for the rest of time I could be opening up letters from friends that wanted to write the way I write because who doesn't want to write the way I write and really its something of a message in the sky to be talking like this but I could earn a living writing like this as I wrote a love letter to no one in particular and I just have to figure out how to publish this love letter to no one in particular because maybe the world is changing faster than I can keep up with and just how it is is just how it is and sometimes the people break easier than the wind does and maybe we never break we just become something that we were never meant to be as angels try and decipher the mind of a demon that is trying to change its ways because I am too old to be chasing anyone and you are too weak to be chasing me and I could just be writing the words that change the lives of the people that want to know how it all happened but they gave me too much time to forget the messages that could be found in the letters that I could write for you and in these letters there was me standing there not talking about anything in particular and quite honestly I am just writing a love letter to no one in particular and really the world is trying to remember me the way the world would like to remember me and if that means I have to sit down and let you know about this then maybe the world is trying to hard to look at me funny because you know I look at you funny and we look at each other funny and its hard to be unemployed when you have to find the time to be someone you are not and maybe if the people that write books were not trying to be someone they are not they could write like me because I live in a world surrounded by a white board that most people find as a limit but I find that situation limitless because then I grab my grease marker and get to adorning that white board with the grease markings that could be the kind of thing that leave behind the things we would have done if we were not in some research laboratory trying to find a reason to use this computer that CERN just droped on us and you know what I love to do with cern ... I love to con cern until we concern ourselves with something more useful to do than pretend we ever needed this lovely unique CPU enabled piece of technology that they gave us for no reason at all and we just looked at them as they dared us to destroy ourselves on ourselves but then the poets came out and let everyone know they had nothing to worry about and in that lack of worrying about anything they had nothing to do other than stare at the world because even CERN is jealous of US and US do US like things like write the kinds of writings that make the world glow with astonishment as we keep coming closer to a public understanding of what it takes to be someone in this strange country that could use a make over by some poets that are training to refrain from destroying all the we hold dear so I am writing a love letter letter to no one in particular because wouldn't you rather read this than a story about a man that had an enigma to solve and then he did and no one connected with the enigma was happy because honestly no one wants to see someone succeed when they are placing bets on not if he fails but how badly and this this writing shows up and we change the way we change the changes in the way we change and I could be trying to establish a connection with the last star fighter because I saw that arcade game there on that dusty movie set and I wanted to play it and why does he get to be the last star fighter and couldn't I try and get a higher score than the last star fighter to play because I got scared when the sword went into the air and yeah I am the kind of writer that wants to say something and maybe you are the woman that wants to hear it and I could be the kind of man that changes your life and you could be the kind of woman that changes mine and through this egotistical exchange of letters I just want to let you know that love is in the air and as an adult we are supposed to let the children love while we make agreements about property and children but maybe I am younger than I look and maybe you are younger than you look and until I actually look old I am not actually just that and as I am writing to the back ends of the woods I am trying to establish a moment that could change my life for the rest of it as I prepare to let the moments of eternity find their ways through my veins as our red blood cells are worth forty trillion dollars each so keep count when they take your blood because our blood is expensive and your blood is expensive and my blood is expensive and each red blood cell is worth forty trillion dollars and maybe its worth pointing out that our over seeers that run for election are not worth the change they try and make because they are usually over seeing systems that never take into account things like twitter or facebook or google and the further into this document you go the further into my mainframe you are going to remember this and we are going to remember each other because through time writers make the moments that we all try and remember and one of these days I am going to try and enlighten a small butter fly and remind it that it used to be a caterpillar and it wont believe me but hey that's fine with me. The other day I was breaking some rules when it came to writing trying to let the world realize that there are no rules when it comes to writing as the blank page is for you to be yourself as bravely as you can possibly be and this is going to find its way to the internet and maybe in that moment someone will remember me and through the escapades of enlightenment I am going to reestablish a connection with the people that want to be people like themselves who are trying to find a piece of meaning in this world that is worth a little more than a white castle hamburger and maybe a love letter to no one in particular will get the attention of some people that want to meet that man that writes like this for no reason at all. The ever present changes that make the world a place where we can meet and piece together the pieces of existence that we all have access to for no reason at all change the way I look at reality in a way you cannot understand unless you know about the same things that I do and yeah angels fall all the time for the men and women of this planet and really its cool to be the kind of person that changes the eternal struggles of a man into the writing that would rearrange the meanings of the words that we play with and maybe the people that make the world work are just trying to better themselves for no reason at all.

			<h2>Princess Tagalong Marries Smoky J</h2>
			<p>
			<h3>The Wedding</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
			It was Sunday. The Church was packed with Oreos, Snickers, Ho Hos, the Orange Family. The floor was covered in gummy bears. The Peppermint Man began to play the tangelo organ on the key lime ivories. It was the classic Coca Cola theme song that played at every Splendiferous Wedding. As the congregants stood in anticipation of the wedding of the Millenium Chewbacca was eating a granola bar and Miss Candy Sunshine was doing hopsctoch. Then a dolphin coughed up some glitter and fourteen clouds had a color battle. The moment had arrived and UGK was did the crip walk krump while Keynan Ivory Wayans high fived Garth Brooks as the Thunder kept its mouth shut for once. 
			</p>
			<p>
			At the front of the Juice Castle stood Lisa Frank the presiding Minister from Give Em Stickers Until the World Ends University. Well she turned in fourteen circles and did a somersault which was the traditional way to begin a marriage ceremony of this historic magnitude.
			</p>
			<p>
			In walked Smoky J. The man of the hour. Man was he cool. Everyone was super super super jealous of him in the Evil Corporate Headquarters Poison Ivy Distribution Plant. He quite his job as the Most High and was a hop scotch champion in the Everglades for about six years. He made purple skittles smiling for a living. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The Ceremony began. 
			</p>
			<p>
			And there she was. Tagalong. The Princess. Princess Tagalong had finally found her man. Princess Tagalong searched through parking lots all over the country from Krogers to Get Your Food Here Inc to Kwiki Mart Parking Lots and thousands of Cheerleading Competitions. She finally fell in real adult love. She was smitten with Smoky J. He was standing at the front of Juice Castle in the space where the groom is supposed to stand. Lisa Frank was just high on life imaging a quantum smile fractal. Everyone was a little spaced out but hey, at least they were in the right building.
			</p>
			<p>
			Pope YouTube was cheesing.
			</p>
			<p>
			Buskin Robbins had sent some flowers. There was a pile of scales and plastic baggies about four feet high.
			</p>
			<p>
			The front row of the Juice Castle was decorated with some denk hydro plants that were just for decoration. Bozo the Clown could not make it do to the fact that he could not find his bonkers nose. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Well , as was tradition in Euphoric Psychotic Perfect Love County. The ceremony would be short as everyone was fairly certain they were missing the latest episode of Duck Tales. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Alright heres what happened next. Princess Tagalong sprinted like a mofo and high fived Smoky J. Smoky J was like. We doin it. Princess Tagalong was like. Word.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jay Z was like … Hova Approves and kissed his opal pinky ring for good luck.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then the deed was done and that is the story of how Girl Scout Cookies and Marijuana became the first two businesses to become wed into the eternal future of time. As apparently the game plan is to spread out like the Girl Scouts will scout out some Prime Girl Scout Locations and the Marijuana Corporation will invest in mad real estate. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Just Remember in about 100 years when the two wealthiest people are just running shit don't be surprised if they just doing it for a merit badge that ain no one ever unlock before.
			</p>
			<p>
			Word is Bond. May Girl Scout Cookies and Marijuna be wed in eternal bliss as , certainly no one saw it coming … but who could state how perfect such a thing is. It just kind of seems like all you need to know is that a girl scout found the sweet spot and a dispensary finally fell in love.
			</p>
			<p>
			The End.

			<h2>1 800 CAP TCHA THEM ALL</h2>
			<p>
			Steven was sitting at his desk trying to subscribe to www.glixter.com when he ran into a Captcha box. So Steven being ever confident in his abilities enters into the box SANGUINE pernicious and confidently clicks the button. Nope. Got it wrong. Then he hits refresh on his Opera browser. Next thing he knows he has been tasked as a human to enter the phrase DELICIOUS sauerkraut. He does so. Nothing happening. Third try. Steven sits down and is tasked with proving he is human a third time. This time he has to enter the phrase GOOD luck. He thought to himself. This is such an easy one. I love it when they are easy. So he types in GOOD luck. Nada.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven hates to do this but he pulls out his iPhone and dials 1 800 CAP TCHA … he waits for it to ring and next thing he knows he hears a voice mail message that asks him to Roar like a lion to prove he is human. He does so. Next thing he knows. He got it wrong. So the voice mail is like … I don't know. Still not certain you are human. Can you try doing fifteen jumping jacks. So Steven does fifteen jumping jacks. Next thing he knows. The Siri is like … I only counted fourteen. Try pouting for about three seconds. So Steven naturally pouts for three seconds. Next thing he knows he hears Siri letting him know that she is convinced he is a human and puts him through to 1 800 CAP TCHA.
			</p>
			<p>
			Megan answers the phone.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Hello, 1 800 CAP TCHA here.”
			</p>
			<p>
			“UUUUUUGGHHH Yeah. So … I'm trying to get my www.glixter.com account set up and I have this Captcha that I really am having trouble with.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			Before Steven can even hang up the phone. The Jake is sitting at his computer.
			</p>
			<p>
			“You Steven?” asked Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			“WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU COME FROM?” asked Steven.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Oh, I used Google Maps to Download Myself to your Desktop.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			“There is an App for that?” said Steven.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Man there is an App for everything.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			Next thing Steven knows Jake pulls out this major magnifying glass that is made from pyryte crystals infused with gallenium sulfide. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“UUUUUH YEAAAAH.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			“What?” asked Steven.
			</p>
			<p>
			“I need to check your pulse.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Why?” said Steven.
			</p>
			<p>
			“So that I can authorize myself to authorize you as a human on www.glixter.com.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			Next thing Steven knows Jake is holding his wrist.
			</p>
			<p>
			About five minutes go by during which Jake and Steven talk about their favorite browsers, cupcakes, how the dolphins are doing in Barbados, and several other key topics that are going to go unmentioned here.
			</p>
			<p>
			A timer goes off that Jake has preselected on his Android Phonie.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Alright. You check out. You are definitely human. Now I can get to work.” said Jake.
			</p>
			<p>
			So Jake pulls up www.glixter.com … scrolls down to the Capture.
			</p>
			<p>
			A bead of sweat falls from his brow.
			</p>
			<p>
			He cracks his neck on both sides.
			</p>
			<p>
			Cracks his knuckles. 
			</p>
			<p>
			And then gets to work.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jake is faced with OMINOUS toaster that he now has to successfully enter.
			</p>
			<p>
			He swaps out Steven's Keyboard for his own.
			</p>
			<p>
			Slowly types in OMINOUS toaster.
			</p>
			<p>
			He's in.
			</p>
			<p>
			Jake hands Steven a bill for roughly fourteen bit coins and tips his hat and reuploads himself to the cloud.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steven is like. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Now I can finally make that meme I always wanted to.

			<p>
			Nice.

			<h2>A Post On Writing By Lucius Pixel</h2>
			
			<p>
			Alright students, I am your professor Professor Professor and I am here today to speak to you about English. It has come to my attention that recently the internet has reached a plataeu in the English language and that there is not enough color in your vocabulary. I want to talk to you about K-Mart words. These are words like cat and dog. See cat and dog are K-Mart words. What you want to do when you get to those pivotal moments in a piece of writing is that instead of saying cat or dog you say feline or canine. Get it. Alright the reason why you do this is quite simple. There are words within this English language that do carry more weight than others. Its not about how deep you are. No one gives a fuck about that. Its about how heavy you are. There is a difference between deep and heavy. See deep is like when you tweet something like … Oh My Gawd Like Tomorrow Will Be Today Someday. Like that's deep. See no one gives a shit about deep. I learned that the hard way. You can spend too much time being deep with someone when you are constantly trying to come up with a business plan. Like yes congratulations you are creating cogent sentences that do have a subject and predicate. You are in line with subject and verb agreement and from time to time you even use a beautiful adjective or something like that. Thing is you need to be heavy. Heavy is where its at. See you can never be too heavy. Heavy is where all of the magic in the English Language is. Heavy is where you infuse a decision into your writing and you can only really be heavy if you have spent enough time reading to know what all of the deep writing is. Like there are millions of pages of deep writing. But heavy writing is where you know a trend in the deep writing world and you just kind of go askew for a second. Like you up on English in a way that lets you know something along the lines of something like this … its when you purposefully utilize words that you are quite certain ain being used that often. Its like when you writing heavy writing you can basically be writing the same style of story that has always written before but because you up on what the typical style of writing is on the only thing that people are reading now a days  … if you know the basic colors of the internet writing styles … you can go off color and the more slightly you are off color in parts of your tone, parts of your vocabulary, it can give your writing weight. Like your typical internet writing is on a certain wavelength because so god damned many people are watching television like its the gold standard in communication. It ain. So like to the degree esssentially which you can weave inside and outside of the way the langauge typically is disseminated to the public at large and to the degree with which you can intersperse your own nice little stylistic choices is to the degree you is heavy.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lets go over this again. Like if you know what most people are reading say around the world. And you know for certain that places like Reddit, Digg, and Wired have a certain percentage of the writing audience on earth. You can take that into account and based on what you see at Reddit, Digg, and Wired and you can utilize the fact that they are a quality sampling of the style of writing that exists on the internet currently and basically all you have to do is keep your subjects in line with your verbs so that you ain writing lines like the ferris wheel spoke which makes no sense. Instead you take a typical line from like Reddit.com which is super heavy online right now which means to a certain extent it has a leadership quality in English on the internet. I would say that most people on Reddit are writing at like an 11th grade level based on the story telling that I am reading so keeping that in mind that the writing level of Reddit which is a healthy cross section of the population, you cater to that writing level. Like I know from Reddit that there is a standard style of writing that people not totally conscious with how performance writing works and how colors of the English language work and may or may not be on vocabulary auto-pilot … like I can read. I read a couple places online and I just notice that the color of the writing is very similar across a sub section of the board for the most part. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have been writing for ten years so on a regular basis when I am writing my sentences I am typically extremely adept at high speed word choice and for the most part I naturally understand from thousands of pages of writing how to affect the color of the writing I am crafting. I typically never really start writing anything unless I can think of a good jump off sentence or concept line. Once I have my concept line its just a matter of following the math for the most part or knowing how to segue into some different math aka style of language. Like when I say style of math its like I am talking about the inspiration for the word choices. Like I am for the most part very in control of what I write and when I was writing at Lucius Pixel Dot Com that was like where I was doing my katas and was in training. Now I am at Vitae Magazine and because I engaged in regular expressions of robustly unnacceptable writing.  I learned the opposite lesson as well. Like I broke so many rules at www.nicholaslawson.com BUT I always made sure to delete my work. I never left anything inflammatory on the front page for more than like an hour or so. I have this one frame to share my writing and its like on vitaemagazine.com I have this elongated frame that just stretches east. Notice how I said east instead of left. Its like east has more heft than left because people talk about left all of the time. Its like the heavier words are all of the words you are familiar with but have not heard in a certain length of time.
			</p>
			<p>
			I just really enjoy utilizing words that people have not heard since ancient times for the most part because to me its the slightly ancient words that carry the most weight. Professor Professor Out.

			Steve had just received his time machine from Amazon.com. It came in a small box wrapped up nice. The first thing Steve did was pull out the instructions for the Time Machine. Steve read. It said that step one was to place the Time Travel helmet on head. The next step was apparently to shake ones head violently as hard as possible from side to side for as long as it takes to get as far into the future as possible. For traveling back in time the directions are explicitly clear as when you wear this helmet to go back in time you are to close your eyes and keep them closed until you end up in the time period you are planning to escape to BUT as soon as you open your eyes again you will magically warp back to the future.
			</p>
			<p>
			Steve was with it.
			</p>
			<p>
			He wanted to go about fifteen minutes into the future. So he put the Time Machine on his head and pulled the strap under his chin. He then proceeded to shake his head side to side as violently as possible. He could really tell that something was happening. It looked like reality was morphing around him in the most bizarre way possible. At one point he let his tongue wag outside of his mouth. He just kept shaking his head until he was literally fifteen minutes in the future. Then he thought about it for a second and the future was not what he thought it would be so he closed his eyes and waited fifteen minutes until he returned to fifteen minutes before he went into the future. Before he did this he made certain to remove the clocks from his house so that he could time travel more purely. 
			</p>
			<p>
			He was satisfied with his purchase.
			</p>
			<p>
			During his extensive time travel studies. He learned something. A computer is the only thing that is known for certain to have been created out of nothing and that has a memory other than well life.

			<strong>My First Music Video</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			Alright so like the most pop sound you could possibly imagine is playing like something just super pop.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then like you see me taking a nap on a park bench in Burnett Woods.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then like I get struck by lighting.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I survive.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I open my mouth and the most powerful lazer ever imagined eminates from it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I spin in a circle and like take off a slice off the moon, part of like Neptune disappears, and like someone gets offed in another galaxy.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I close my mouth and just look around.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then noticing that I am safe.
			</p>
			<p>
			I lay back down and go back to my nap.
			</p>
			<p>
			Fade into Dream Sequence
			</p>
			<p>
			Smurfette is on Vitae Magazine Dot Com leaving a comment.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I wake up again and aim my head down and open my mouth.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am now being propelled by the force of the lazer into the sky.
			</p>
			<p>
			I pass a flock of bald eagles that are happening by.
			</p>
			<p>
			I give the thumbs up that everything is okay.
			</p>
			<p>
			I close my mouth for a moment to lose altitude.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I open it up again as I am flexing my entire body.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am then propelled into the stratosphere where I am scared shitless.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I realize that I can time travel too.
			</p>
			<p>
			So I send the most powerful lazer beam back to the origin of the universe where I start it all over.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I lightly let myself down back to earth.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I realize even that is a dream.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then I stand up from the park bench.
			</p>
			<p>
			Start whistling.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like WHOAH!

			<h2>It's Your Choice Who You Listen To ... </h2>
			<p>
			I was thirty three years old. Looking back on my life from my last moments. I had the decision to pass on to the next life, or I could go back and do some things over. I led a long life but went in the wrong direction. They say your life passes before your eyes as you are dying, and well, I like to believe that is to let you choose when you can go back and become conscious from a certain moment. As though you get a single life to live any way you want as maybe an animal would your first time on this plane. Then as you are experiencing death you can go back and enter into yourself from another point and do something different or better or worse or whatever you want. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Its almost as if I have these memories of these moments that never happened. I am almost certain I have died if not once, twice, thrice, or even many more times. My main question in life is not if I have died before, its how many times exactly have I died. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I almost feel like this is my home. This time period and I might feel like this is my last time here. Like maybe the next time I am faced with to go on to the next life or to make changes to this life again. That I will not. I just wonder. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Death. This concept that I am more concerned with not experiencing so that maybe I do not have to flow through another life. As though when you splice into that moment again, you have to go on auto pilot through your life up to that point and then … you just wake up. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Realize you are back here. That the same catastrophe is almost always occurring. That the same threat of the loss of civilization is always present.
			</p>
			<p>
			Its just that I just find this life mysterious. Like there is a part of me that just cannot let this life go and maybe I am in the process of living it out the last time. Like maybe I almost feel like I have learned my lesson.
			</p>
			<p>
			I experience moments where I was standing in London it felt like when a Nuclear Warhead fell and I woke up as a wall of fire engulfed me. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I experience moments where I was being chased to my death by people at the last White Power rally at the top of my street.
			</p>
			<p>
			I experience moments where men with the most worried looks on their faces are staring at me as though I was the worst man to ever live.
			</p>
			<p>
			I experience moments where the strangest green organisms fell from the sky and released so much poison that most people died.
			</p>
			<p>
			I experience moments where I know I travel. I know from the clarity of what I see at night when I close my eyes that this is my home. I enter into the darkness of night and then I just go somewhere. I just work on behalf of the human experience to keep it here.
			</p>
			<p>
			I just have these experiences where my body speaks to me and I can feel energy that I am getting used to reading in my body. I feel pressures in my chest that I never talk about. I feel monologues passing through my mind that no one is ever aware they are the source of. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have this strange existence and when I say that your life is normal, or your life is charmed, its because I know you do not experience what I experience.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am so embarrassed by my eighteen psychiatric hospitalizations. I even remember in high school in Chemistry class just this moment where I knew that I should be afraid of psychiatry. Then it came to be. I wonder what the source of my pain is. What the source of pain is in general. I just wonder about the possibility that I am involved in a game. As though the future may be such a boring place that a space is created where we can create stories for ourselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
			As though this is not real. As though I will wake up one day and be somewhere that this just is not. I just sit back and remember watching the Matrix, Vanilla Sky, Eternal Sunshine of a Beautiful Mind, Tron and the such and I just from this style of highly advanced film making have to wonder where such stories come from.
			</p>
			<p>
			How many people wish they never knew me? How often do I just become someone that people are not interested in knowing.
			</p>
			<p>
			I went to London, I came back and no one talked to me. I lost myself in a city that I should never have visited. I became involved with something that I should never have. I left my city and there was a riot as though I was involved as though because I left some kind of abstract energy that I eminate just caused my city to dissolve in my absence. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I have so many what most would be consider strange thought but if I went back 200 years in time and described to people how what we really need are glowing boxes that have words on them, or small rectangles that we could put up to our ears so that we could talk to someone on another continent, or contraptions with four wheels that would carry us around the country side. I would be seen as just as inane then as I am now.
			</p>
			<p>
			I just feel like we do not need more things. We have the things we need. I am more interested in seeing these things perfected. Like I stare at this computer every day and I get it, the forces of capitalism are at play here. Normally there is differentiation in the business world. Someone invents Coca Cola and then someone invents Pepsi. I get that. It makes sense it helps provide choices for people.
			</p>
			<p>
			But when it comes to content management, and history, and the human condition. Is not there a need to look at this computer and catalog it's use somehow so that a path can be gifted to our grand children. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Its almost as if everything was perfect in business leading up to this thing but this thing. This computer connected to all of the other computers. I am certain its supposed to be treated differently. It is in fact a content management system but there is a most perfect incarnation of this thing and I just wonder about Facebook and Google and I just think to myself. Why do they need to keep working on their projects? I understand it. There is this thing called business but the internet, it was never meant to have business done on it.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like if you want to improve it that is fine, but to get involved in the practice of not perfecting something so that you can keep your job? Like, is not this more important than that?
			</p>
			<p>
			I just remember the future of my life and I just feel like on this path it just keeps getting worse as though something horrific is being planned and I just have this feeling that we can do something different, the future is a decision that we make.
			</p>
			<p>
			I know of this research at Berkley where they are researching dreams. It really interests me and I would love nothing more than to see the commercialization of dreams research. I would love to sleep in an MRI machine if I had to every night just so that I could wake up and watch my dreams from the night before. 
			</p>
			<p>
			You have no idea how my mind works. I literally watch movies most of the time and maybe it has to do with my writing habit that my mind is open and from my open mind I just experience life. I just feel like I have this voice that is mine. I just feel like I have this people that are living and I just want what is best for all of us. I just do.
			</p>
			<p>
			I had this vision of my family being horrified of me as though in another life I was the worst human being that there ever was but someone or something keeps giving me chances to get it right and I just keep getting it wrong as though there is something perfect I can do that will make this all better. That will open people's eyes up to a reality that are just numb to or unaware of.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have said so many as you call them prayers but really I just know that I developed a part of my brain where through saying so many internal mantras I just know that there is this part of the brain that if you use it , will open you up. I just think to myself how did people in the ancient world find each other. Like is telepathy real? Is it as natural as eyesight? Is it something we are all capable of depending on your ability to open yourself up to prayer. Like Scientists are typically atheists so they would never pray or think to learn how to but what if there was Scientist that was truly open minded, what could they envision?
			</p>
			<p>
			Like the world is strange, let us not act as though this is understood by anyone. What is wrong with a mystery? When it comes to mysteries are they not more valuable than facts in some fashion?
			</p>
			<p>
			Like my life is a mystery to me that I keep experiencing. I honestly have no idea why I have not been killed yet. I honestly have no idea why Meech just did not pummel me. I have no idea why I would live in a city that would factually find me so disastrous a person that they would incarcerate me 18 times and then set me free.
			</p>
			<p>
			Like am I not dangerous? Is not my destiny to be placed somewhere that I can do no more damage to people? I have this family that is just so astonishingly hard for me to spend time with and then when it goes wrong they continually act as though I should just be as happy or well behaved as them but when I see them all I see are the people that were never there for me, or were the people that put me away, or that testified against me. I know they think I am strange and in that they have no love for me but I am to have love for them. I just wonder why they do not just leave me be.
			</p>
			<p>
			How can you continually be a source of pain for someone and then at the same time expect them to be a certain way? I just have no idea.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have been through so much and from time to time I am asked why I am not the way I used to be, and its because I have been through so much pain that I realized I could not be as open to people as I used to be. I used to love people to no end and loved just meeting all of the new people I could but now. I just. Well. I just wish that most people would just leave me alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have this journey that I am on. I used to be such an extrovert and now I am the most introverted man I know of as though I found this place in my mind I never knew of before. This never ending space where conversation happens constantly. I feel like I found something inside myself that may dwell in all of us and that it is unlocked from well writing, prayer, and reading. Through lifetimes of reading, praying, and writing the mind becomes as though a lens capable of knowing all. There is no limit to what the mind can know but there is a part of the mind that does make decisions as that is the part that fascinates me the most. The part that is conscious that makes the decisions. The part that does the deciding in the brain. I am a self contained unit but I have no idea why I am conscious of myself. I know my mind is essentially the same as yours but why are you not writing? Why are you not praying? Why are you not reading? Why am I found to be so such the way I am and it is as though I am found to be lacking in person or strange all because you just never read, write, or pray? 
			</p>
			<p>
			I am amazed at how many problems could be solved by people just being civilized and its not that I do not know how to fight its just that I have no interest to do so as though if I were going to fight it would be on a battlefield in a war that was meant to defend my city or country. I just do not understand this need for war. Its amazing to me. Like killing people changes someone in the most dramatic way and then to just kill and kill and kill and kill over and over again.
			</p>
			<p>
			Maybe it just has never been explained to me properly. On what grounds is War so important next to the build up of poetic cultures, or what? Why must it never end as someone told me? What? 
			</p>
			<p>
			Like on a certain level I approached as though I am someone, but when I watch television and I just see people wantonly killing each other on some level I just think to myself, well, their punishment for their behavior is their memory of their actions and I leave it alone.
			</p>
			<p>
			If I was on the battlefield with an AK-47 I would be capable of ending all that was in front of me. If I was a commander in chief it would be explained to me who the enemy was and I would just say, arm the nuclear warheads. I just would. If I was to be a war hero it is because I would end the enemy in the shortest possible way. I would just in the right position at this point of never ending war state that the enemy whoever it is … is to be defeated. Why the prolonged war, why not end their existence profoundly? Why are we dragging this out?
			</p>
			<p>
			Is it because the military is volunteer operated and maybe they want to train boy scouts or something and give them their experience as patriots or something? Like if our nation is at war, why are we not ending the enemy?
			</p>
			<p>
			I know in my peaceful ways that I am peaceful because I do not want to end life if there is any other way. Like if I was to take a life it would be the most very last resort there would be but at the point where I have no other option than to end life in War, I use nuclear warheads and just end it.
			</p>
			<p>
			It would be the simplest thing for me to do. To just give the order to drop the nuclear warheads and then I would in the safety of my nation drink some tea and wait for the reports to come in that the enemy just does not exist any more.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have no basis for caring about life after what I have been through. It is all down to my behavior when faced with certain threats and if you are not a threat to me, well then polite conversation can be had but  I am almost certain I am wanted dead by someone and this person is waiting somewhere just wanting it to happen but what are they waiting for?
			</p>
			<p>
			Why the constant need NOT to engage in work to its completion? If you want to build a computer finish it? If you want to war, finish it? Is not the completion of a project more profound a moment than all of the moments leading up to a moment? Is not the purpose of business to finish something?
			</p>
			<p>
			When it comes to my life. I can be whoever you want me to be. I can give rousing speeches to incite national love of nation. I can keep quiet and never say a word. I can apply to be a police officer and fight crime. I can buy cocaine and sell cocaine until I can buy a yacht. I can run for political office and work to be a politician or I can just vote. I can go to the open mic or I can make You Tube Videos.
			</p>
			<p>
			All I know is that I am permanently disabled according to the government and on a certain level that just speaks to me that during the next holocaust I would be killed and they are just waiting for the right time to end me.
			</p>
			<p>
			If I was to take on the role of Fuhrer, I would use water instead of fire as though if it were me in Adolf's Position I would never have invaded Poland and I would have just built giant glass encased cubes where I would have dropped bodies in so that people would remember forever that something went too far and something had to happen.
			</p>
			<p>	
			My only question of Adolf was why use fire when water would have sufficed, why invade Poland when staying in his country would have been more in line with success?
			</p>
			<p>
			I am so neutral at any given moment I am just watching and growing in power. I essentially want to do nothing but I have to do something so I write. I just have no concept of why anything should or should not be done and do I not deserve to be ended for thinking these thoughts?
			</p>
			<p>
			Why am I singled out as a severe problem to society and then allowed to be free and to have this time and this platform to speak my labeled insane mind?
			</p>
			<p>
			On some level I just think most of you have no idea what you are doing.
			</p>
			<p>
			So I just write.
			</p>

			<h2>7 Things Performing at an Open Mic Teaches You</h2>
			<p>
			One: Being the center of attention can be extremely cool, fun, rewarding, and invigorating. When you are at the open mic and you are performing for a group of people at your local club you become something that you were not before. You become your best person and you become filled with confidence. When you are performing hot pieces of poetry at the slam competition you are at you become peaceful and serene and you fall in love with the idea that people are really listening to you. That is what makes it cool, fun, rewarding, and invigorating.
			</p>
			<p>
			Two: Being yourself and speaking your piece is the most important thing. It does not hurt to speak from the depths of your heart and to fasten yourself to a thought that you can then share with the world at large. When you are performing your writing that you crafted yourself that is your moment to shine and when you come to find out that when you are being the truest form of yourself that even that person is embraced by an audience. That is the whole reason to go.
			</p>
			<p>
			Three: Not caring about what people think begins at open mics. I was booed a couple times for my work and I learned it does not hurt to express yourself in a way that people object to and as people were booing me other people were cheering. Its chaos at an open mic but you learn to feel a form of energy that comes out of yourself and when you are just on the edge of your consciousness freestyling poetry and not knowing what you are going to say next in front of a group of people its excitement and more nourishing for the soul than sitting at home and watching television in my opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
			Four: Peeking behind the curtains of entertainment begins at open mics if you go to enough shows. If you spend time at a solid show that brings in dozens if not hundreds of people over the months of being a regular open mic show that books talent and that attracts community you can get a pretty good understanding of how the entertainment industry works and then once you have that understanding, you can see through the hype of the smoke and mirrors of the quote unquote celebrity. There is a lot of posturing that goes into celebrity and performing at an open mic helps you care a lot less about the current state of celebrity that is reported on TMZ and Entertainment Tonight and it draws you more into your community and the people around you. All things being equal your best friend is as talented as the winner American Idol and that in fact American Idol is in fact a devout style of open mic … the Slam. Your friend is as talented as the people on television and you are too. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Five: You learn hand to hand business and how to handle transactions and freeloaders. You learn doorman skills at an open mic. You learn that if you do not take the money from their hands they will try and get to the hot show without paying. You learn that most people are cool about paying but some people feel that they are connected to the show even though they are audience members and it’s the audience members that feel that they are part of the show that cause the most problems. Performers make the show and the audience participates by paying to be entertained. That’s the deal. It pays to remember that at that door.
			</p>
			<p>
			Six: Amazing long lasting friendships are fostered at community driven open mics. You meet some amazing people at a regular open mic and it’s cool to see how people have their own voices and facets to their personalities that come out at open mics. Drinks and tea and the fact that you never know what you are going to hear at an open mic that is the center of the city’s consciousness is invigorating and there is a great amount of comradery at the open mic that just cannot be found anywhere else.
			</p>
			<p>
			Seven and Lastly: I will never understand why my local church that I was raised in never had an open mic, it seems fair to let the community speak to the community than to have the same person doing the sermon every week. I learned this and maybe you would too if you attended an open mic for enough weeks is that the open mic ceremony while much maligned is a more balanced ceremony for society than the leader driven church model most people are currently aware of and participating in. The world would be much more confident if more people spent more time spending more time speaking in front of more people. I learned that.

			<h2>Race Writing (Rioting)</h2>
			<p>
			I was training to become the leader of thought I knew I could be championing the moment like I was trying to see into a new reality where conformity was the norm and I was not trying to be in line with this version of reality. I was explaining to myself that writing was where I needed to be either in computer science on the pc or something else entirely. I could be a conduit in time to a conduit through rhyme that was naturally and extension of my cosmology that was coming out of me awkwardly like I was destined to be the poet that you see drafting these lessons in crafting messages to gaia rhetorical stances on information I was discerning lessons to wanting to be a computer scientist the way computer was science I was moving through séances with elation because I could better change the station on rhyme and become a new writer that was changing his dimes listening to music all the time like wondering why it had to be the guy that was challenging the assumptions of kissing like conundrums they were giving up on me and I was giving up on them this was a bad fit for reasons that were too awkward to partake of and I was the sentient force of the universe staring at these people like bring the noose and end this dissection of an elaborate manipulation of the remembrances of exchanges of how it has to be like there is a way it has to be could it be the way it has to be it only has a way its guaranteed to be if you are a robot in seek of a need to be breathe free the air is right through this wearing of astonishment and they say I do nothing but I do something for the reasons I do everything and I have done more before and now I am learning to become more than an instructor these new movements in rhyme are gutting me like I am shutting out my spine and wondering why I ever chose to come to this planet why did I choose to challenge myself with this place that information was forbade and I could not say what I needed to say so I wrote like I was choking on penn station cheese steaks and I could equate the lineage of evocations of everything that was ever meant to be into a moment that I would never see as the future looked bright to me and either harmony or melody was going to challenge me and my fingers were striking keys like one two three and I was manipulating the energy that was in side of me like harry potter was a character in a book and I had his same chemistry and the story was not the same for me but be she a billionaire or be she an unknowing witness of the challenges of mistakes that have yet to be given I was sticking to the facts of the cases and erasing the changes that we were making and I was cast from society into this place where I had to hide because my energy was the reason why people were looking for me to die that kind of death that I have not experienced yet and it’s the kind that deals with the lack of breath as they are certain they have no use for me and I am behind the times and ahead of the climb as I am being replaced by my new cousin of dozens of wonderings of I am not coming back no I am going forward like I am going to die of a heart of attack and then I am going to send my sentience to the future where I will see who knows what but I will not be stuck in this meat locker any longer and the surrounding sentences that surround me are so filled with ignorance its hard for me to understand your lessons and I am too skilled to be here in thoughts and I am reasoning that my elation is to be in a place where the machines have been built and my constitution has yet to be written and I am smitten and I just know you are not getting the best out of me but you have to understand that I am passing through with passing grades and there are to many failures to know how I have it made and just because you have some paper in your hand does not mean you are wealthier than me because time is money and money is time and cash is a resource that I purchase with a rhyme and passing sales between cables in return for lessons in numbers that I am unfamiliar with you may not like my rhetoric but that does not mean we have found a way out of this lesson yet and I am changing the preponderances of escalades of time spent rewinding clocks back to midnight and I have fourth eye vision eyesight and the night lights of the tantrums of the drums that come into the moonlight are like twilight just before nightfall or just before morning and I am mourning the passing of gratuities into confines of realities that I am challenging like stations of the cross references to the cross how many times did they reference the cross and was this all being lost as one man died to pay the cost of the words that we were working with and an infinite number of people raised to an infinite power minus the energy of one man brings about a conversation so unbalanced that all there is to do is bring out the band and we can enjoy our sins as we forgive ourselves for our dinner that we dine on ducks and chickens and cows and pigs and I can tell this is the middle ages because just because we have some technology does not mean that culturally we are not moving backwardly into an era where anyone can be anything and we mostly want to be cosmetically who we are challenging the stations in life never wanting to become the adults we are supposed to be so failure to the people that fucked and had children before they were ready and if you knew you were not supposed to be having children shame on you for doing so and love is such a hard word to spell and most of you cannot even spell your names as it’s a shame the way that parenting is being done and I come from natural parenting genius as four children graduated from the university and I am here challenging the ethos of the regrowth of the population into educated monuments to the national challenge divine and you were to stupid to ever see her naked and you could not take care of yourself and now you have a child to take care of and there should be successful adults championing the enlightenment of the birth of successful children and one day we are all going to be sterile and the children are going to come from test tubes and the children are not going to have parents and we are going to make fucking in the moonlight illegal because the lower classes are finished kicking the asses of the upper classes that got the grades in high school and this is all a classroom to me and most of you cheated of me when you were sitting next to me and your work is worthless and the majority of you are copy cats that have no confidence and the intelligence to stand on your own is what you lack and your finest accomplishment is going to be to get your dick wet and to lay there letting some man throw semen into your ocean and then you are going to let nature take its course and of course you believe that you are men and women and you yearn to be free like when you were children and responsibility is something that you never knew you could learn appreciate and now you are the forebearing the next generation and you are being left behind by your children and writing is something that you cannot do and if you had to teach your own children you would not even know what to do or where to start and the greatest joke you can think of is that moment where you fart and you are going to embark upon a tradition of hatred because your ignorance placates you and you disassociate yourself from the language and you think you have something to say when the state should be raising your child anyways and  the world is an oyster and I am its pearl and I gave up trying to be someone I am not and so one day I might meet the girl that could say the world is for her and we can raise the next generation of the lawsons that raised me and inherently I know how to raise a child intelligently and the majority of you let the state do your work because you never paid attention and your genes are all fucked and maybe this has to do with a population boom or maybe it just has to do with the fact that you don’t give a fuck and you sit in the bleachers staring at children playing sports we do not need and life is not about entertaining ourselves its about learning to be thinking about the future in deed and developing strategies that will allow us to grow and develop and solve more powerful problems that come our way and become the aliens that travel the universe as all of us are capable of building rockets and maybe most of you should go back to high school and retrace your steps and this computer is not for browsing for porn and downloading god knows what its for reading the news and press releases and trying to understand how the world words and the computer is a work station that is not intended to be used for games and if you are playing video games you have even more of my disdain and I smoke cigarettes and I hate phillip morris and tobacco has my low brow and I am not perfect either and I do not think I need to be to let you know you are less perfect than me and one day robots will be driving buses and then bus drivers will be making less than me and we are replacing ourselves with conterparts that work twenty four seven and all that is going to be left to do is create culture and create children as the world is transitioning through transhumanism and my grandmother witnessed radio and television and I witnessed the ipod and the iphone and its all transitioning so quickly and the inventions keep coming and people keep trying to make their money by rearranging the resources of our time period into problem solving utility knives that become common place and then they trade their stocks on the market and people that have money pay people to make them more money and I make money by writing you can tell because my notes are written one at a time and maybe the elders are looming over and I am grooming myself to become a leader not too early and not too soon and at a time period where my past leaves me with nothing left to do other than to explain my points of view and I need you to hate my ethos so that we can grow too and I could be changing the weather with my thoughts and we could be gravitating through creativity and I am interested in letting the computer channel my thoughts through the processes of process that process my processes of thought and I thought I could process my thoughts in process and I am mitigating impressions and really the world is changing into a work station and I am elating to find myself meditating on a keyboard and some trance music and I could dance groove it through it to the tune of the music but then I would be the one to do it and I could really embrace the hatred I feel for Africans and as a European my ancient enemy has come and found me here amongst the worlds where we compare ourselves to each other and the African has their mud huts and their disheveled continent compared to Europe and what is the difference between Africa and Europe as the tones spill over to America and I could imagine being confused as an African in America staring at the discovery channel and trying to fathom how my people are still working on their spears while the Europeans are working on sending their next astronaut into space this year and yes Michael Jordan did jump from the foul line and he did reach around from the bassline in the united states playing a game that was built by Europeans and African women are attracted to European men and European men are attracted to African women and African men are attracted to European women and European women are attracted to African men because European women have something in common with African men and they are both the weaker forms of their ethnicity and in their weakness they feel a bond and the bond between the African woman the European man is one of wondering why their own counterparts of their own ethnicities is so much weaker than they never get anything right and the love between the European man and the African woman is eternal and the weaker genders of the two races love each other for their weakness while the African woman loves the European man and the European man loves the African woman and the strength of the bond between these two is a balance in social chemistry as they make sense to be the anchors of their races and two anchors coming together make for powerful children as African men are like children and European women are like emotional outcasts to themselves and the African woman is like the goddess of the human species engendering power behind her eyes and an elegance in her movements that challenge the way the world works and she is forever trying to keep propagating her species while her ethnic counterpart is trying to play the game of life and fuck as much as possible without taking advantage of raising their children and the European wife does not want to be tied down to family life and the African woman wants to raise a family and the European man wants to raise a family and in tradition this is the observance from what I have seen and the American society where Africans and Europeans mix is a place of comparison warfare with our two back home continents showing each others potential and when a European man does not live up to his potential as a European he is hated and when an African American succeeds where his African counterpart does not he is lauded and Europeans are expected to succeed because it is traditional for them to have mastery over the universe and it is traditional for African men to not have mastery over their domain but in the united states the majority of city dwelling men and women of all races have roughly the same resources with which to begin their journey as businessmen and the game is that we know the traditions of the people we are dealing with at a stereotypical level because of television and the radio and our media as the majority of us have never been to Africa and asia and Europe and Australia and antartica but we see images and hear stories on television and we have never experienced slavery but we hear stories of it and the game play between the races in the united states has to do with how the moment is going to be perceived in contrast the way the history of our species is represented as the African American male would like for the European American male to be represented in the media as bumbling and idiotic even though traditionally the European male is one of mastery of skill and the European male would like for the African American male to be made out to be good at something and if rap be that thing than so be it so long as they can find something to care about which they have traditionally never been able to find because they wanted to find something that they can say they started and the African American is in a constant conundrum because they want to be treated like kings and queens in an era where the kings and queens are Europeans and the Africans want to be at the top of the food chain of culture and commerce and quite frankly such a thing is happening as their socio economic framework only works to its full potential when they have access to a pop culture mind map where they are represented as the greats so that they can feel positive about themselves and quite frankly in the united states the African American has recently taken a stance on positivity noting that being ever presently positive is actually quite annoying to the population at large given that they are just now starting to get an economic base beneath them due to the fact that in history they were left with nothing in the united states around the same time period as everyone was left with nothing but their language was unaccustomed to the concept of building and invention so they have had a hard time progressing as a people because they are not built to invent and build and create no they are more built to generate social ceremony and to create conversation more than say chop wood or anything like that. The African American male would rather do something simple than complex and the European male would rather do something complex than simple and the African female would rather do something complex than simple and the European female would rather do something simple than complex.
