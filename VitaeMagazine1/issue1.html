			<h2>Origins of Dirt and God</h2>
			<img src = "../images/CircleOfEyes.jpg" alt="Circle of Eyes" width ="100%"><br><br>
			<p>
			Rapping around the controversial entropy of the existence of diagrams of sentences that ramble on for days I am playing by the rules telling no story just letting the words come out of me as I am defining my reason for being in these sentences as this is what I am good at just writing and the difference between writing and authorship is that writing has no plot its just when the words wont stop and I could cop a feel in between you and me and wrap my head around a mast head and defeat a diatribe one last time as I am coming to the conclusion that I need to find that thing that I am amazing at so that I can share my pomposity with the world around me because poetry is the best thing that ever came out of me and the world is voting republican and I forgot to vote and the last notes of the dying breeds of men and their wishes for their children that they forget about when they enter the job site is astounding to me as just so long as you are not working in a factory you are intelligentsia and its hard out there for a politician and what is that anyways as I could be the man that writes the letters that change the way people view letters as what do I need to say to define a generation in a way that makes it hard to believe that maybe I could be interviewing men my age and we could be exchanging energy and testing the waters to see who is who and did you see your job through and josh mandel is the man that is the secretary of state in the state of ohio and I am the author that is writing the winters snow and maybe there are men that are willing to jump through hoops for easy pay checks as the reasons for the divisions of labor are that the less intelligent men do the brutish work and the more intelligent men do the thought work because that is the way it has to be or else there would be nothing for the less intelligent to do as the intelligent men and women of this world run it or at least that is the way it is supposed to be but the way it really is couples with men paying police officers to do their job and the Abrahamic laws stop the lawsuits from championing as we are European ethics wrapped up in American culture as making money is the same as making noise and I could be discontinuing coins and they talk about god in Colorado and they talk about god in Massachusetts and they talk about god in ohio and they debate the existence of God.
			</p>
			<p>
			I am here to settle the debate once and for all. The existence of God is real. You can in fact see God. In fact you can spell God out. G O D. That is what God looks like.  Eleven words behind this word is what God looks like. You could see God twice in the line above me. God exists inside of Typography and that is the only place that God exists. This serves the purposes of proving the Atheists Wrong and the Theists Correct and Angers the Theists as that is not what they are talking about and Enhappys the Atheists in that they figured as much. At the Crucicble of God you find the Word God and with the Word was God and God was the original word that children spoke and men tremble before God and God is powerful to the illiterate as we never really know if anyone can really read.  God is the most powerful word because in God there is literacy and a civilization advanced enough to create  Glyphy Typography and cares enough to write down and God is the omnipotent set of glyphs that exists only in Typography and you cannot find God on the Moon and you cannot find God in the sun. 
			</p>
			<p>
			They say God created the Universe and maybe they are wrong as Theists want to label a dominant author of the universe with crafting the language in a certain way and Theists are just as bad as Atheists in the debate over god.  What am I trying to say. The world belongs to typographers. They are the original people that took the time to craft the symbols that we use blatantly to represent our thought patterns and no one knows a typographer. They are mysterious figures that graduate from design schools and go off into worlds unknown to develop the tools we use to communicate with. It was a typographer that created God and that typographer carved God into a clay tablet and that man created the first word and the man that created the first word was with God and saw God working through such a being and that being that wrote God first and crafted the words of God was a typographer and the realm of typography is the only realm you will see God working.
			</p>
			<p>
			All poetry aside, I propose this as a meeting ground that is actually a correct answer. In a world where Priests and Rabbis and Muslim Clerics state that there is a God. I would like to point out that they are correct. I would also like to point out that Atheists are incorrect when they state there is no God as there is. The word “GOD” exists. Those three symbols that rest between those parehtnsises happen in fact to be the God that exists. The only one we can be certain of that exists is that God. I would imagine that a Theist would think God would be greater than this and an Atheist would huff and say well that is all that is.
			<p>
			I would like to point out something. I am comfortable with this God. I marvel at this God. I marvel at civilization that developed language. God exists only in typography ergo language. You can say you are God to possibly induce fear or respect from someone but in that you are utilizing God in the language. God is a sound, an image, a thought, for lack of a better concept, it is a meme. A device. God has been passed down through time as a means of developing people’s brains and allowing them to see into themselves. You can chant God you can draw God on paper but God is that which exists in a story. It is that which exists in language and communication and symbolic representation of thought. That is the extent of God. We want to place labels and use language to try and communicate that there was intelligence that created as an example dirt. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The typical creation debate is comprised of two men that are fighting over dirt. They are fighting over where the dirt came from. One man says that a super natural being with omnipotent powers in comparison to humans created dirt and the other man is trying to say that the dirt has always been there. They go to war and attempt to kill each other over such a message because the man that says God created the dirt has children that he wants to believe God created the dirt and the man that says the dirt has always been there has children and he wants them to believe that the dirt has always been there and these two men are fighting over the sounds that float through the air being ever so careful to develop buildings and lines of logic and stories and pop up books and universities and debates and all manner of show just to try and get their children to believe one way or the other. Either a mystical more powerful than human creature created the dirt or the dirt has always been there.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is the debate that is religion. The men and the women of religion are fighting over dirt. That is the conversation that is religion. That is the crux that is the focal point of the religions of the world. They are fighting over dirt. They debate dirt endlessly. It is a never ending debate and at some point their children choose sides and there is money to be made talking about dirt and where the dirt came from and how old the dirt came and while all of this is going on there are crops growing from the dirt feeding the people that are working together to build an elaborate empire of novelty of cars and of computer and of coca cola all the while on the weekends they debate the existence of dirt and where it came from while the dirt is providing us with trees and animals and there are character composites for the types of people that debate that God created dirt and most of the time these people also hate men that see no trouble falling in love with another man and women that fall in love with another woman then you have the people that believe the dirt has always been here which in terms of debate and story telling and social organization are typically the most foul mouthed cannot get anything right mean spirited care nothing about human life type of people and these are the people that are staging impromptu debates over God where Christopher Hitchens spent his life earning a living talking about dirt and now he is back in the dirt and the dirt is where the conversation starts and ends. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I am impressed with the God inside of Typography. It suits me. I need no God that created anything. I need a God that we as humans created whose form existed before humans. There is more nuance in the word God than I can express over the course of my entire life. I see a picture of a man standing in a design studio staring at a wall debating with another man over whether the typography on this word  God is beautiful enough, ugly enough, finite enough, italic enough.
			</p>
			<p>
			I see the history of language and the history of typography as more beautiful than the history of what people do with typography. I see most people abusing typography and language and the people that abuse it the most have no idea what it is or what the world is like when you know what an ascender is or a serif. 
			</p>
			<p>
			There are people that know what serifs are and there are people that do not. There are people that know what sans serif means and there are people that do not. When you get interested in language and typography it changes your life and you know it’s an obscure interest to be interested in but its life changing in that you get to see where God really is. God is in the language and in knowing that you get to see the theatre of the Theist and the Theatre of the Atheists and for a brief moment if you are steady you get to understand that millions of people in their ignorance , have no idea what they are talking about but you know that common ground is always what is being looked for
			</p>
			<p>
			So you propose that factually God exists. There is a God. There is a sound God and there is an English Typographic combination of Alphanumeric Glyphs that represent God. That is the God that exists whether I believe in God or not. It does not matter whether or not I believe in God because God exists.
			</p>
			<p>
			So after a decade of wondering whether or not God exists. I had to admit that God did exist and that God is a word and that as amazing as I want god to be is as amazing as Words are and as small as God is is as small as words are.
			</p>
			<p>
			I just know that God is real because  God is the word that I can see.

			<h2>If I Hate Anything, I Hate the Camera</h2>
			<img src = "../images/NeoUnitedStatesFlag.jpg" alt="What the United States Flag Could Be" width ="100%"><br><br>
			<p>
			The United States of America. We are the melting pot and after years of melting the United States has taken on a bit of an edgy vibe. We are in our media quite angry and willing to discuss anything. What has been our greatest drawback. It has been the camera. The camera itself. The photography camera and the video camera have been our greatest detriment. The entire process of photography taking apart the moment and dissolving our memories into moments that are to be known as too foreign for our lives to live with.
			</p>
			<p>
			It has been the camera pulling people out of lives that should never have been. The greatest creation of false wealth has been the camera. Great amounts of work and tedium go into the capturing of moments that should never have been. The still camera is the lowest form of creation cultivating a robbing of our hands of the work that should have been theirs.
			</p>
			<p>
			The still camera divides our society in terms of who should be placed in front of it. The curve of photography went from novelty and returned to novelty. We are awash in images that disrupt the real shock value that we would encounter upon having seen things that our eyes would never have needed to see. In a world where you can see with vivid detail that which you have never seen your mind creates a memory that is more false than false money. There is never going to be a recalling of the camera. It seems like an innocent enough device. As innocent as one feels before one pulls a trigger on a gun. There is nothing glowing that can warn of us our greatest weaknesses but the still camera that serves no purpose other than to rob us our actual memories. We have seen a great deal and in seeing more than we feel we have felt we feel numb to the actual world around us.
			</p>
			<p>
			There is also the motion camera. This camera itself is the root of the most evil on this planet. It robs people of their sense of composure and creates false industry. Extremely bright minds partake of the motion camera industry in such a way that other more important industries are robbed of their talent and effort. There is a misalignment of talent and intelligence where the quote unquote beautiful and talented flock to places where there are many cameras. It is the places where there is the most cameras and the dream of living a false life for a living that many flock to.
			</p>
			<p>
			The library of content that was crafted from the camera seems innocent enough but in terms of where we are compared to where we could be has been robbed for ever and to note this. Imagine an internet free of motion video and photography. It would be just text. It would be just reading. There would be a world of reading shared with a readers of the word and in that world there is no animosity against the subjects of the camera. Over and over the same subjects are chosen for the camera setting a blaze of indignation in our society that creates a class war over something that no one has a means of controlling. We cannot control the way we look and in this we subconsciously fight to receive compensation for being the subject.
			</p>
			<p>
			There is the camera in its lack of glory serving no purpose whatsoever. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The photograph at the top of this page serves to remind us where we could be in our pursuit of excellence in contrast to where we are in part because of the backwards evolution the camera has wrought on us.

			<h2>A Hot Couple Verses</h2>
			<img src = "../images/Author0.jpg" alt="Lucius Pixel the Author" width ="100%"><br><br>
			<p>
			Dropping lines on the times I was faced with I graced the stages of the places I was retracing my steps trying to find a manuscript that I had not written yet. I was writing like I was dying into an oblivion that I had never dared to enter into yet. Died three times last week and still made it to the podium for my turn to speak. Trying to unwind the divinity inside the lines of my writing I was trying to enlighten the sacrifices of my enticing diction that was worth more than writing fiction because you know the page does not lie and my writing voice is the one that’s going to make the world cry when I intone that I am the Christ that is just passing through time letting the words slip off my fingers like where is the harmony behind your eyes and if you have melodies let me listen to those notes like who wrote this masterpiece. I might be the least gangster in the land with my university degree behind me and I am delving into tantric might be the greatest lover since the man that walked on water over the seven seas. I am what you see coming out of UC and I don’t need to spit into a mic to let the world see who flows with the cosmos like I got my keys right in front of me as I unlock the door to my serendipity listening to hip hop beats on Spotify like I might be the reason why the world is turning out to be the flawless diamond of intelligence that it needs to be to make it out of the realms of existence it was never meant to see and how you gonna fuck hardcore on beeg nad not expect a man like me to see might be the unloved children of the parental units that were never meant to breed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Im like changing mentions of methods of my style letting the world rest for a while while I dabble in the unseen letters of mayhem underneath the high beams of you need to see me in action to understand the words I gleam. Im like gunning full steam might have to get my laptop pull it out my pocket open the lock it of creativity on these beasts on the scene step into a coffee shop and project my project and let the projected income fall into my bank account. Im performance computing you don’t think this is soothing writing well I do fuck a grey goose and let me get drunk on some gin and tonic why bother I am hardly the fortune teller’s fortune that cannot predict my introspective ions that be shooting out of my sionic nature like a creature from the lock ness Im the mystical ethereal Lucius pixel coming through with a miracle that might set the whole club loose.
			</p>
			<p>
			Might do something different like install a lap top from my back pocket into a power socket and let my fingers do the walking all the while im gonna be talking a different language because im fluent in like seven ranges of intellect and I ain even done pronouncing my English yet and as you follow along on the page I could serenade a tempest with a tantrum that makes me know that I am made and it ain even my kind of demeanor to worry about the grades all I need to do is pull out my chrome and my projector and and my screen and let the whole world see me being me letting the letters fall out of me full steam. Im like penning a pad that is lavish and glad to see the other writers putting their verses together full of the curses that keep the diction full of the fiction of the lifestyles of the rich or famous because you cannot be both and I could write a letter to the mayor or just cut my own throat. 
			</p>
			<p>
			No need to gloat Im the most original that made it over the moat in the human race which is the equivalent of some sperm that appeared and had no reason to understand it could never brace for the impact of the shine of the sun this or any previous year. Im like the broken jokes all seeped into the septum building up my momentum into a diatribe that might anger more than one guy when they learn how made my earnings and the funny thing is. I did it on the first try.
